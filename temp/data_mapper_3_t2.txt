god 1
help 1
those 1
who 1
wander 1
into 1
the 1
great 1
mire 1
now, 1
for 1
even 1
the 1
firm 1
uplands 1
are 1
becoming 1
a 1
morass. 1
i 1
found 1
the 1
black 1
tor 1
upon 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
seen 1
the 1
solitary 1
watcher, 1
and 1
from 1
its 1
craggy 1
summit 1
i 1
looked 1
out 1
myself 1
across 1
the 1
melancholy 1
downs. 1
rain 1
squalls 1
drifted 1
across 1
their 1
russet 1
face, 1
and 1
the 1
heavy, 1
slate-coloured 1
clouds 1
hung 1
low 1
over 1
the 1
landscape, 1
trailing 1
in 1
grey 1
wreaths 1
down 1
the 1
sides 1
of 1
the 1
fantastic 1
hills. 1
in 1
the 1
distant 1
hollow 1
on 1
the 1
left, 1
half 1
hidden 1
by 1
the 1
mist, 1
the 1
two 1
thin 1
towers 1
of 1
baskerville 1
hall 1
rose 1
above 1
the 1
trees. 1
they 1
were 1
the 1
only 1
signs 1
of 1
human 1
life 1
which 1
i 1
could 1
see, 1
save 1
only 1
those 1
prehistoric 1
huts 1
which 1
lay 1
thickly 1
upon 1
the 1
slopes 1
of 1
the 1
hills. 1
nowhere 1
was 1
there 1
any 1
trace 1
of 1
that 1
lonely 1
man 1
whom 1
i 1
had 1
seen 1
on 1
the 1
same 1
spot 1
two 1
nights 1
before. 1
as 1
i 1
walked 1
back 1
i 1
was 1
overtaken 1
by 1
dr. 1
mortimer 1
driving 1
in 1
his 1
dog-cart 1
over 1
a 1
rough 1
moorland 1
track 1
which 1
led 1
from 1
the 1
outlying 1
farmhouse 1
of 1
foulmire. 1
he 1
has 1
been 1
very 1
attentive 1
to 1
us, 1
and 1
hardly 1
a 1
day 1
has 1
passed 1
that 1
he 1
has 1
not 1
called 1
at 1
the 1
hall 1
to 1
see 1
how 1
we 1
were 1
getting 1
on. 1
he 1
insisted 1
upon 1
my 1
climbing 1
into 1
his 1
dog-cart, 1
and 1
he 1
gave 1
me 1
a 1
lift 1
homeward. 1
i 1
found 1
him 1
much 1
troubled 1
over 1
the 1
disappearance 1
of 1
his 1
little 1
spaniel. 1
it 1
had 1
wandered 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
moor 1
and 1
had 1
never 1
come 1
back. 1
i 1
gave 1
him 1
such 1
consolation 1
as 1
i 1
might, 1
but 1
i 1
thought 1
of 1
the 1
pony 1
on 1
the 1
grimpen 1
mire, 1
and 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
fancy 1
that 1
he 1
will 1
see 1
his 1
little 1
dog 1
again. 1
“by 1
the 1
way, 1
mortimer,” 1
said 1
i 1
as 1
we 1
jolted 1
along 1
the 1
rough 1
road, 1
“i 1
suppose 1
there 1
are 1
few 1
people 1
living 1
within 1
driving 1
distance 1
of 1
this 1
whom 1
you 1
do 1
not 1
know?” 1
“hardly 1
any, 1
i 1
think.” 1
“can 1
you, 1
then, 1
tell 1
me 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
any 1
woman 1
whose 1
initials 1
are 1
l. 1
l.?” 1
he 1
thought 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
minutes. 1
“no,” 1
said 1
he. 1
“there 1
are 1
a 1
few 1
gipsies 1
and 1
labouring 1
folk 1
for 1
whom 1
i 1
can’t 1
answer, 1
but 1
among 1
the 1
farmers 1
or 1
gentry 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
one 1
whose 1
initials 1
are 1
those. 1
wait 1
a 1
bit 1
though,” 1
he 1
added 1
after 1
a 1
pause. 1
“there 1
is 1
laura 1
lyons—her 1
initials 1
are 1
l. 1
l.—but 1
she 1
lives 1
in 1
coombe 1
tracey.” 1
“who 1
is 1
she?” 1
i 1
asked. 1
“she 1
is 1
frankland’s 1
daughter.” 1
“what! 1
old 1
frankland 1
the 1
crank?” 1
“exactly. 1
she 1
married 1
an 1
artist 1
named 1
lyons, 1
who 1
came 1
sketching 1
on 1
the 1
moor. 1
he 1
proved 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
blackguard 1
and 1
deserted 1
her. 1
the 1
fault 1
from 1
what 1
i 1
hear 1
may 1
not 1
have 1
been 1
entirely 1
on 1
one 1
side. 1
her 1
father 1
refused 1
to 1
have 1
anything 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
her 1
because 1
she 1
had 1
married 1
without 1
his 1
consent 1
and 1
perhaps 1
for 1
one 1
or 1
two 1
other 1
reasons 1
as 1
well. 1
so, 1
between 1
the 1
old 1
sinner 1
and 1
the 1
young 1
one 1
the 1
girl 1
has 1
had 1
a 1
pretty 1
bad 1
time.” 1
“how 1
does 1
she 1
live?” 1
“i 1
fancy 1
old 1
frankland 1
allows 1
her 1
a 1
pittance, 1
but 1
it 1
cannot 1
be 1
more, 1
for 1
his 1
own 1
affairs 1
are 1
considerably 1
involved. 1
whatever 1
she 1
may 1
have 1
deserved 1
one 1
could 1
not 1
allow 1
her 1
to 1
go 1
hopelessly 1
to 1
the 1
bad. 1
her 1
story 1
got 1
about, 1
and 1
several 1
of 1
the 1
people 1
here 1
did 1
something 1
to 1
enable 1
her 1
to 1
earn 1
an 1
honest 1
living. 1
stapleton 1
did 1
for 1
one, 1
and 1
sir 1
charles 1
for 1
another. 1
i 1
gave 1
a 1
trifle 1
myself. 1
it 1
was 1
to 1
set 1
her 1
up 1
in 1
a 1
typewriting 1
business.” 1
he 1
wanted 1
to 1
know 1
the 1
object 1
of 1
my 1
inquiries, 1
but 1
i 1
managed 1
to 1
satisfy 1
his 1
curiosity 1
without 1
telling 1
him 1
too 1
much, 1
for 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
reason 1
why 1
we 1
should 1
take 1
anyone 1
into 1
our 1
confidence. 1
tomorrow 1
morning 1
i 1
shall 1
find 1
my 1
way 1
to 1
coombe 1
tracey, 1
and 1
if 1
i 1
can 1
see 1
this 1
mrs. 1
laura 1
lyons, 1
of 1
equivocal 1
reputation, 1
a 1
long 1
step 1
will 1
have 1
been 1
made 1
towards 1
clearing 1
one 1
incident 1
in 1
this 1
chain 1
of 1
mysteries. 1
i 1
am 1
certainly 1
developing 1
the 1
wisdom 1
of 1
the 1
serpent, 1
for 1
when 1
mortimer 1
pressed 1
his 1
questions 1
to 1
an 1
inconvenient 1
extent 1
i 1
asked 1
him 1
casually 1
to 1
what 1
type 1
frankland’s 1
skull 1
belonged, 1
and 1
so 1
heard 1
nothing 1
but 1
craniology 1
for 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
our 1
drive. 1
i 1
have 1
not 1
lived 1
for 1
years 1
with 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
for 1
nothing. 1
i 1
have 1
only 1
one 1
other 1
incident 1
to 1
record 1
upon 1
this 1
tempestuous 1
and 1
melancholy 1
day. 1
this 1
was 1
my 1
conversation 1
with 1
barrymore 1
just 1
now, 1
which 1
gives 1
me 1
one 1
more 1
strong 1
card 1
which 1
i 1
can 1
play 1
in 1
due 1
time. 1
mortimer 1
had 1
stayed 1
to 1
dinner, 1
and 1
he 1
and 1
the 1
baronet 1
played 1
écarté 1
afterwards. 1
the 1
butler 1
brought 1
me 1
my 1
coffee 1
into 1
the 1
library, 1
and 1
i 1
took 1
the 1
chance 1
to 1
ask 1
him 1
a 1
few 1
questions. 1
“well,” 1
said 1
i, 1
“has 1
this 1
precious 1
relation 1
of 1
yours 1
departed, 1
or 1
is 1
he 1
still 1
lurking 1
out 1
yonder?” 1
“i 1
don’t 1
know, 1
sir. 1
i 1
hope 1
to 1
heaven 1
that 1
he 1
has 1
gone, 1
for 1
he 1
has 1
brought 1
nothing 1
but 1
trouble 1
here! 1
i’ve 1
not 1
heard 1
of 1
him 1
since 1
i 1
left 1
out 1
food 1
for 1
him 1
last, 1
and 1
that 1
was 1
three 1
days 1
ago.” 1
“did 1
you 1
see 1
him 1
then?” 1
“no, 1
sir, 1
but 1
the 1
food 1
was 1
gone 1
when 1
next 1
i 1
went 1
that 1
way.” 1
“then 1
he 1
was 1
certainly 1
there?” 1
“so 1
you 1
would 1
think, 1
sir, 1
unless 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
other 1
man 1
who 1
took 1
it.” 1
i 1
sat 1
with 1
my 1
coffee-cup 1
halfway 1
to 1
my 1
lips 1
and 1
stared 1
at 1
barrymore. 1
“you 1
know 1
that 1
there 1
is 1
another 1
man 1
then?” 1
“yes, 1
sir; 1
there 1
is 1
another 1
man 1
upon 1
the 1
moor.” 1
“have 1
you 1
seen 1
him?” 1
“no, 1
sir.” 1
“how 1
do 1
you 1
know 1
of 1
him 1
then?” 1
“selden 1
told 1
me 1
of 1
him, 1
sir, 1
a 1
week 1
ago 1
or 1
more. 1
he’s 1
in 1
hiding, 1
too, 1
but 1
he’s 1
not 1
a 1
convict 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
i 1
can 1
make 1
out. 1
i 1
don’t 1
like 1
it, 1
dr. 1
watson—i 1
tell 1
you 1
straight, 1
sir, 1
that 1
i 1
don’t 1
like 1
it.” 1
he 1
spoke 1
with 1
a 1
sudden 1
passion 1
of 1
earnestness. 1
“now, 1
listen 1
to 1
me, 1
barrymore! 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
interest 1
in 1
this 1
matter 1
but 1
that 1
of 1
your 1
master. 1
i 1
have 1
come 1
here 1
with 1
no 1
object 1
except 1
to 1
help 1
him. 1
tell 1
me, 1
frankly, 1
what 1
it 1
is 1
that 1
you 1
don’t 1
like.” 1
barrymore 1
hesitated 1
for 1
a 1
moment, 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
regretted 1
his 1
outburst 1
or 1
found 1
it 1
difficult 1
to 1
express 1
his 1
own 1
feelings 1
in 1
words. 1
“it’s 1
all 1
these 1
goings-on, 1
sir,” 1
he 1
cried 1
at 1
last, 1
waving 1
his 1
hand 1
towards 1
the 1
rain-lashed 1
window 1
which 1
faced 1
the 1
moor. 1
“there’s 1
foul 1
play 1
somewhere, 1
and 1
there’s 1
black 1
villainy 1
brewing, 1
to 1
that 1
i’ll 1
swear! 1
very 1
glad 1
i 1
should 1
be, 1
sir, 1
to 1
see 1
sir 1
henry 1
on 1
his 1
way 1
back 1
to 1
london 1
again!” 1
“but 1
what 1
is 1
it 1
that 1
alarms 1
you?” 1
“look 1
at 1
sir 1
charles’s 1
death! 1
that 1
was 1
bad 1
enough, 1
for 1
all 1
that 1
the 1
coroner 1
said. 1
look 1
at 1
the 1
noises 1
on 1
the 1
moor 1
at 1
night. 1
there’s 1
not 1
a 1
man 1
would 1
cross 1
it 1
after 1
sundown 1
if 1
he 1
was 1
paid 1
for 1
it. 1
look 1
at 1
this 1
stranger 1
hiding 1
out 1
yonder, 1
and 1
watching 1
and 1
waiting! 1
what’s 1
he 1
waiting 1
for? 1
what 1
does 1
it 1
mean? 1
it 1
means 1
no 1
good 1
to 1
anyone 1
of 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
baskerville, 1
and 1
very 1
glad 1
i 1
shall 1
be 1
to 1
be 1
quit 1
of 1
it 1
all 1
on 1
the 1
day 1
that 1
sir 1
henry’s 1
new 1
servants 1
are 1
ready 1
to 1
take 1
over 1
the 1
hall.” 1
“but 1
about 1
this 1
stranger,” 1
said 1
i. 1
“can 1
you 1
tell 1
me 1
anything 1
about 1
him? 1
what 1
did 1
selden 1
say? 1
did 1
he 1
find 1
out 1
where 1
he 1
hid, 1
or 1
what 1
he 1
was 1
doing?” 1
“he 1
saw 1
him 1
once 1
or 1
twice, 1
but 1
he 1
is 1
a 1
deep 1
one 1
and 1
gives 1
nothing 1
away. 1
at 1
first 1
he 1
thought 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
the 1
police, 1
but 1
soon 1
he 1
found 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
some 1
lay 1
of 1
his 1
own. 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
gentleman 1
he 1
was, 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
he 1
could 1
see, 1
but 1
what 1
he 1
was 1
doing 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
make 1
out.” 1
“and 1
where 1
did 1
he 1
say 1
that 1
he 1
lived?” 1
“among 1
the 1
old 1
houses 1
on 1
the 1
hillside—the 1
stone 1
huts 1
where 1
the 1
old 1
folk 1
used 1
to 1
live.” 1
“but 1
how 1
about 1
his 1
food?” 1
“selden 1
found 1
out 1
that 1
he 1
has 1
got 1
a 1
lad 1
who 1
works 1
for 1
him 1
and 1
brings 1
all 1
he 1
needs. 1
i 1
dare 1
say 1
he 1
goes 1
to 1
coombe 1
tracey 1
for 1
what 1
he 1
wants.” 1
“very 1
good, 1
barrymore. 1
we 1
may 1
talk 1
further 1
of 1
this 1
some 1
other 1
time.” 1
when 1
the 1
butler 1
had 1
gone 1
i 1
walked 1
over 1
to 1
the 1
black 1
window, 1
and 1
i 1
looked 1
through 1
a 1
blurred 1
pane 1
at 1
the 1
driving 1
clouds 1
and 1
at 1
the 1
tossing 1
outline 1
of 1
the 1
wind-swept 1
trees. 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
wild 1
night 1
indoors, 1
and 1
what 1
must 1
it 1
be 1
in 1
a 1
stone 1
hut 1
upon 1
the 1
moor. 1
what 1
passion 1
of 1
hatred 1
can 1
it 1
be 1
which 1
leads 1
a 1
man 1
to 1
lurk 1
in 1
such 1
a 1
place 1
at 1
such 1
a 1
time! 1
and 1
what 1
deep 1
and 1
earnest 1
purpose 1
can 1
he 1
have 1
which 1
calls 1
for 1
such 1
a 1
trial! 1
there, 1
in 1
that 1
hut 1
upon 1
the 1
moor, 1
seems 1
to 1
lie 1
the 1
very 1
centre 1
of 1
that 1
problem 1
which 1
has 1
vexed 1
me 1
so 1
sorely. 1
i 1
swear 1
that 1
another 1
day 1
shall 1
not 1
have 1
passed 1
before 1
i 1
have 1
done 1
all 1
that 1
man 1
can 1
do 1
to 1
reach 1
the 1
heart 1
of 1
the 1
mystery. 1
chapter 1
11. 1
the 1
man 1
on 1
the 1
tor 1
the 1
extract 1
from 1
my 1
private 1
diary 1
which 1
forms 1
the 1
last 1
chapter 1
has 1
brought 1
my 1
narrative 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
eighteenth 1
of 1
october, 1
a 1
time 1
when 1
these 1
strange 1
events 1
began 1
to 1
move 1
swiftly 1
towards 1
their 1
terrible 1
conclusion. 1
the 1
incidents 1
of 1
the 1
next 1
few 1
days 1
are 1
indelibly 1
graven 1
upon 1
my 1
recollection, 1
and 1
i 1
can 1
tell 1
them 1
without 1
reference 1
to 1
the 1
notes 1
made 1
at 1
the 1
time. 1
i 1
start 1
them 1
from 1
the 1
day 1
which 1
succeeded 1
that 1
upon 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
established 1
two 1
facts 1
of 1
great 1
importance, 1
the 1
one 1
that 1
mrs. 1
laura 1
lyons 1
of 1
coombe 1
tracey 1
had 1
written 1
to 1
sir 1
charles 1
baskerville 1
and 1
made 1
an 1
appointment 1
with 1
him 1
at 1
the 1
very 1
place 1
and 1
hour 1
that 1
he 1
met 1
his 1
death, 1
the 1
other 1
that 1
the 1
lurking 1
man 1
upon 1
the 1
moor 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
found 1
among 1
the 1
stone 1
huts 1
upon 1
the 1
hillside. 1
with 1
these 1
two 1
facts 1
in 1
my 1
possession 1
i 1
felt 1
that 1
either 1
my 1
intelligence 1
or 1
my 1
courage 1
must 1
be 1
deficient 1
if 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
throw 1
some 1
further 1
light 1
upon 1
these 1
dark 1
places. 1
i 1
had 1
no 1
opportunity 1
to 1
tell 1
the 1
baronet 1
what 1
i 1
had 1
learned 1
about 1
mrs. 1
lyons 1
upon 1
the 1
evening 1
before, 1
for 1
dr. 1
mortimer 1
remained 1
with 1
him 1
at 1
cards 1
until 1
it 1
was 1
very 1
late. 1
at 1
breakfast, 1
however, 1
i 1
informed 1
him 1
about 1
my 1
discovery 1
and 1
asked 1
him 1
whether 1
he 1
would 1
care 1
to 1
accompany 1
me 1
to 1
coombe 1
tracey. 1
at 1
first 1
he 1
was 1
very 1
eager 1
to 1
come, 1
but 1
on 1
second 1
thoughts 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
both 1
of 1
us 1
that 1
if 1
i 1
went 1
alone 1
the 1
results 1
might 1
be 1
better. 1
the 1
more 1
formal 1
we 1
made 1
the 1
visit 1
the 1
less 1
information 1
we 1
might 1
obtain. 1
i 1
left 1
sir 1
henry 1
behind, 1
therefore, 1
not 1
without 1
some 1
prickings 1
of 1
conscience, 1
and 1
drove 1
off 1
upon 1
my 1
new 1
quest. 1
when 1
i 1
reached 1
coombe 1
tracey 1
i 1
told 1
perkins 1
to 1
put 1
up 1
the 1
horses, 1
and 1
i 1
made 1
inquiries 1
for 1
the 1
lady 1
whom 1
i 1
had 1
come 1
to 1
interrogate. 1
i 1
had 1
no 1
difficulty 1
in 1
finding 1
her 1
rooms, 1
which 1
were 1
central 1
and 1
well 1
appointed. 1
a 1
maid 1
showed 1
me 1
in 1
without 1
ceremony, 1
and 1
as 1
i 1
entered 1
the 1
sitting-room 1
a 1
lady, 1
who 1
was 1
sitting 1
before 1
a 1
remington 1
typewriter, 1
sprang 1
up 1
with 1
a 1
pleasant 1
smile 1
of 1
welcome. 1
her 1
face 1
fell, 1
however, 1
when 1
she 1
saw 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
a 1
stranger, 1
and 1
she 1
sat 1
down 1
again 1
and 1
asked 1
me 1
the 1
object 1
of 1
my 1
visit. 1
the 1
first 1
impression 1
left 1
by 1
mrs. 1
lyons 1
was 1
one 1
of 1
extreme 1
beauty. 1
her 1
eyes 1
and 1
hair 1
were 1
of 1
the 1
same 1
rich 1
hazel 1
colour, 1
and 1
her 1
cheeks, 1
though 1
considerably 1
freckled, 1
were 1
flushed 1
with 1
the 1
exquisite 1
bloom 1
of 1
the 1
brunette, 1
the 1
dainty 1
pink 1
which 1
lurks 1
at 1
the 1
heart 1
of 1
the 1
sulphur 1
rose. 1
admiration 1
was, 1
i 1
repeat, 1
the 1
first 1
impression. 1
but 1
the 1
second 1
was 1
criticism. 1
there 1
was 1
something 1
subtly 1
wrong 1
with 1
the 1
face, 1
some 1
coarseness 1
of 1
expression, 1
some 1
hardness, 1
perhaps, 1
of 1
eye, 1
some 1
looseness 1
of 1
lip 1
which 1
marred 1
its 1
perfect 1
beauty. 1
but 1
these, 1
of 1
course, 1
are 1
afterthoughts. 1
at 1
the 1
moment 1
i 1
was 1
simply 1
conscious 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
presence 1
of 1
a 1
very 1
handsome 1
woman, 1
and 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
asking 1
me 1
the 1
reasons 1
for 1
my 1
visit. 1
i 1
had 1
not 1
quite 1
understood 1
until 1
that 1
instant 1
how 1
delicate 1
my 1
mission 1
was. 1
“i 1
have 1
the 1
pleasure,” 1
said 1
i, 1
“of 1
knowing 1
your 1
father.” 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
clumsy 1
introduction, 1
and 1
the 1
lady 1
made 1
me 1
feel 1
it. 1
“there 1
is 1
nothing 1
in 1
common 1
between 1
my 1
father 1
and 1
me,” 1
she 1
said. 1
“i 1
owe 1
him 1
nothing, 1
and 1
his 1
friends 1
are 1
not 1
mine. 1
if 1
it 1
were 1
not 1
for 1
the 1
late 1
sir 1
charles 1
baskerville 1
and 1
some 1
other 1
kind 1
hearts 1
i 1
might 1
have 1
starved 1
for 1
all 1
that 1
my 1
father 1
cared.” 1
“it 1
was 1
about 1
the 1
late 1
sir 1
charles 1
baskerville 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
come 1
here 1
to 1
see 1
you.” 1
the 1
freckles 1
started 1
out 1
on 1
the 1
lady’s 1
face. 1
“what 1
can 1
i 1
tell 1
you 1
about 1
him?” 1
she 1
asked, 1
and 1
her 1
fingers 1
played 1
nervously 1
over 1
the 1
stops 1
of 1
her 1
typewriter. 1
“you 1
knew 1
him, 1
did 1
you 1
not?” 1
“i 1
have 1
already 1
said 1
that 1
i 1
owe 1
a 1
great 1
deal 1
to 1
his 1
kindness. 1
if 1
i 1
am 1
able 1
to 1
support 1
myself 1
it 1
is 1
largely 1
due 1
to 1
the 1
interest 1
which 1
he 1
took 1
in 1
my 1
unhappy 1
situation.” 1
“did 1
you 1
correspond 1
with 1
him?” 1
the 1
lady 1
looked 1
quickly 1
up 1
with 1
an 1
angry 1
gleam 1
in 1
her 1
hazel 1
eyes. 1
“what 1
is 1
the 1
object 1
of 1
these 1
questions?” 1
she 1
asked 1
sharply. 1
“the 1
object 1
is 1
to 1
avoid 1
a 1
public 1
scandal. 1
it 1
is 1
better 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
ask 1
them 1
here 1
than 1
that 1
the 1
matter 1
should 1
pass 1
outside 1
our 1
control.” 1
she 1
was 1
silent 1
and 1
her 1
face 1
was 1
still 1
very 1
pale. 1
at 1
last 1
she 1
looked 1
up 1
with 1
something 1
reckless 1
and 1
defiant 1
in 1
her 1
manner. 1
“well, 1
i’ll 1
answer,” 1
she 1
said. 1
“what 1
are 1
your 1
questions?” 1
“did 1
you 1
correspond 1
with 1
sir 1
charles?” 1
“i 1
certainly 1
wrote 1
to 1
him 1
once 1
or 1
twice 1
to 1
acknowledge 1
his 1
delicacy 1
and 1
his 1
generosity.” 1
“have 1
you 1
the 1
dates 1
of 1
those 1
letters?” 1
“no.” 1
“have 1
you 1
ever 1
met 1
him?” 1
“yes, 1
once 1
or 1
twice, 1
when 1
he 1
came 1
into 1
coombe 1
tracey. 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
very 1
retiring 1
man, 1
and 1
he 1
preferred 1
to 1
do 1
good 1
by 1
stealth.” 1
“but 1
if 1
you 1
saw 1
him 1
so 1
seldom 1
and 1
wrote 1
so 1
seldom, 1
how 1
did 1
he 1
know 1
enough 1
about 1
your 1
affairs 1
to 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
help 1
you, 1
as 1
you 1
say 1
that 1
he 1
has 1
done?” 1
she 1
met 1
my 1
difficulty 1
with 1
the 1
utmost 1
readiness. 1
“there 1
were 1
several 1
gentlemen 1
who 1
knew 1
my 1
sad 1
history 1
and 1
united 1
to 1
help 1
me. 1
one 1
was 1
mr. 1
stapleton, 1
a 1
neighbour 1
and 1
intimate 1
friend 1
of 1
sir 1
charles’s. 1
he 1
was 1
exceedingly 1
kind, 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
through 1
him 1
that 1
sir 1
charles 1
learned 1
about 1
my 1
affairs.” 1
i 1
knew 1
already 1
that 1
sir 1
charles 1
baskerville 1
had 1
made 1
stapleton 1
his 1
almoner 1
upon 1
several 1
occasions, 1
so 1
the 1
lady’s 1
statement 1
bore 1
the 1
impress 1
of 1
truth 1
upon 1
it. 1
“did 1
you 1
ever 1
write 1
to 1
sir 1
charles 1
asking 1
him 1
to 1
meet 1
you?” 1
i 1
continued. 1
mrs. 1
lyons 1
flushed 1
with 1
anger 1
again. 1
“really, 1
sir, 1
this 1
is 1
a 1
very 1
extraordinary 1
question.” 1
“i 1
am 1
sorry, 1
madam, 1
but 1
i 1
must 1
repeat 1
it.” 1
“then 1
i 1
answer, 1
certainly 1
not.” 1
“not 1
on 1
the 1
very 1
day 1
of 1
sir 1
charles’s 1
death?” 1
the 1
flush 1
had 1
faded 1
in 1
an 1
instant, 1
and 1
a 1
deathly 1
face 1
was 1
before 1
me. 1
her 1
dry 1
lips 1
could 1
not 1
speak 1
the 1
“no” 1
which 1
i 1
saw 1
rather 1
than 1
heard. 1
“surely 1
your 1
memory 1
deceives 1
you,” 1
said 1
i. 1
“i 1
could 1
even 1
quote 1
a 1
passage 1
of 1
your 1
letter. 1
it 1
ran 1
‘please, 1
please, 1
as 1
you 1
are 1
a 1
gentleman, 1
burn 1
this 1
letter, 1
and 1
be 1
at 1
the 1
gate 1
by 1
ten 1
o’clock.’” 1
i 1
thought 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
fainted, 1
but 1
she 1
recovered 1
herself 1
by 1
a 1
supreme 1
effort. 1
“is 1
there 1
no 1
such 1
thing 1
as 1
a 1
gentleman?” 1
she 1
gasped. 1
“you 1
do 1
sir 1
charles 1
an 1
injustice. 1
he 1
_did_ 1
burn 1
the 1
letter. 1
but 1
sometimes 1
a 1
letter 1
may 1
be 1
legible 1
even 1
when 1
burned. 1
you 1
acknowledge 1
now 1
that 1
you 1
wrote 1
it?” 1
“yes, 1
i 1
did 1
write 1
it,” 1
she 1
cried, 1
pouring 1
out 1
her 1
soul 1
in 1
a 1
torrent 1
of 1
words. 1
“i 1
did 1
write 1
it. 1
why 1
should 1
i 1
deny 1
it? 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
reason 1
to 1
be 1
ashamed 1
of 1
it. 1
i 1
wished 1
him 1
to 1
help 1
me. 1
i 1
believed 1
that 1
if 1
i 1
had 1
an 1
interview 1
i 1
could 1
gain 1
his 1
help, 1
so 1
i 1
asked 1
him 1
to 1
meet 1
me.” 1
“but 1
why 1
at 1
such 1
an 1
hour?” 1
“because 1
i 1
had 1
only 1
just 1
learned 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
london 1
next 1
day 1
and 1
might 1
be 1
away 1
for 1
months. 1
there 1
were 1
reasons 1
why 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
get 1
there 1
earlier.” 1
“but 1
why 1
a 1
rendezvous 1
in 1
the 1
garden 1
instead 1
of 1
a 1
visit 1
to 1
the 1
house?” 1
“do 1
you 1
think 1
a 1
woman 1
could 1
go 1
alone 1
at 1
that 1
hour 1
to 1
a 1
bachelor’s 1
house?” 1
“well, 1
what 1
happened 1
when 1
you 1
did 1
get 1
there?” 1
“i 1
never 1
went.” 1
“mrs. 1
lyons!” 1
“no, 1
i 1
swear 1
it 1
to 1
you 1
on 1
all 1
i 1
hold 1
sacred. 1
i 1
never 1
went. 1
something 1
intervened 1
to 1
prevent 1
my 1
going.” 1
“what 1
was 1
that?” 1
“that 1
is 1
a 1
private 1
matter. 1
i 1
cannot 1
tell 1
it.” 1
“you 1
acknowledge 1
then 1
that 1
you 1
made 1
an 1
appointment 1
with 1
sir 1
charles 1
at 1
the 1
very 1
hour 1
and 1
place 1
at 1
which 1
he 1
met 1
his 1
death, 1
but 1
you 1
deny 1
that 1
you 1
kept 1
the 1
appointment.” 1
“that 1
is 1
the 1
truth.” 1
again 1
and 1
again 1
i 1
cross-questioned 1
her, 1
but 1
i 1
could 1
never 1
get 1
past 1
that 1
point. 1
“mrs. 1
lyons,” 1
said 1
i 1
as 1
i 1
rose 1
from 1
this 1
long 1
and 1
inconclusive 1
interview, 1
“you 1
are 1
taking 1
a 1
very 1
great 1
responsibility 1
and 1
putting 1
yourself 1
in 1
a 1
very 1
false 1
position 1
by 1
not 1
making 1
an 1
absolutely 1
clean 1
breast 1
of 1
all 1
that 1
you 1
know. 1
if 1
i 1
have 1
to 1
call 1
in 1
the 1
aid 1
of 1
the 1
police 1
you 1
will 1
find 1
how 1
seriously 1
you 1
are 1
compromised. 1
if 1
your 1
position 1
is 1
innocent, 1
why 1
did 1
you 1
in 1
the 1
first 1
instance 1
deny 1
having 1
written 1
to 1
sir 1
charles 1
upon 1
that 1
date?” 1
“because 1
i 1
feared 1
that 1
some 1
false 1
conclusion 1
might 1
be 1
drawn 1
from 1
it 1
and 1
that 1
i 1
might 1
find 1
myself 1
involved 1
in 1
a 1
scandal.” 1
“and 1
why 1
were 1
you 1
so 1
pressing 1
that 1
sir 1
charles 1
should 1
destroy 1
your 1
letter?” 1
“if 1
you 1
have 1
read 1
the 1
letter 1
you 1
will 1
know.” 1
“i 1
did 1
not 1
say 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
read 1
all 1
the 1
letter.” 1
“you 1
quoted 1
some 1
of 1
it.” 1
“i 1
quoted 1
the 1
postscript. 1
the 1
letter 1
had, 1
as 1
i 1
said, 1
been 1
burned 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
all 1
legible. 1
i 1
ask 1
you 1
once 1
again 1
why 1
it 1
was 1
that 1
you 1
were 1
so 1
pressing 1
that 1
sir 1
charles 1
should 1
destroy 1
this 1
letter 1
which 1
he 1
received 1
on 1
the 1
day 1
of 1
his 1
death.” 1
“the 1
matter 1
is 1
a 1
very 1
private 1
one.” 1
“the 1
more 1
reason 1
why 1
you 1
should 1
avoid 1
a 1
public 1
investigation.” 1
“i 1
will 1
tell 1
you, 1
then. 1
if 1
you 1
have 1
heard 1
anything 1
of 1
my 1
unhappy 1
history 1
you 1
will 1
know 1
that 1
i 1
made 1
a 1
rash 1
marriage 1
and 1
had 1
reason 1
to 1
regret 1
it.” 1
“i 1
have 1
heard 1
so 1
much.” 1
“my 1
life 1
has 1
been 1
one 1
incessant 1
persecution 1
from 1
a 1
husband 1
whom 1
i 1
abhor. 1
the 1
law 1
is 1
upon 1
his 1
side, 1
and 1
every 1
day 1
i 1
am 1
faced 1
by 1
the 1
possibility 1
that 1
he 1
may 1
force 1
me 1
to 1
live 1
with 1
him. 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
that 1
i 1
wrote 1
this 1
letter 1
to 1
sir 1
charles 1
i 1
had 1
learned 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
prospect 1
of 1
my 1
regaining 1
my 1
freedom 1
if 1
certain 1
expenses 1
could 1
be 1
met. 1
it 1
meant 1
everything 1
to 1
me—peace 1
of 1
mind, 1
happiness, 1
self-respect—everything. 1
i 1
knew 1
sir 1
charles’s 1
generosity, 1
and 1
i 1
thought 1
that 1
if 1
he 1
heard 1
the 1
story 1
from 1
my 1
own 1
lips 1
he 1
would 1
help 1
me.” 1
“then 1
how 1
is 1
it 1
that 1
you 1
did 1
not 1
go?” 1
“because 1
i 1
received 1
help 1
in 1
the 1
interval 1
from 1
another 1
source.” 1
“why 1
then, 1
did 1
you 1
not 1
write 1
to 1
sir 1
charles 1
and 1
explain 1
this?” 1
“so 1
i 1
should 1
have 1
done 1
had 1
i 1
not 1
seen 1
his 1
death 1
in 1
the 1
paper 1
next 1
morning.” 1
the 1
woman’s 1
story 1
hung 1
coherently 1
together, 1
and 1
all 1
my 1
questions 1
were 1
unable 1
to 1
shake 1
it. 1
i 1
could 1
only 1
check 1
it 1
by 1
finding 1
if 1
she 1
had, 1
indeed, 1
instituted 1
divorce 1
proceedings 1
against 1
her 1
husband 1
at 1
or 1
about 1
the 1
time 1
of 1
the 1
tragedy. 1
it 1
was 1
unlikely 1
that 1
she 1
would 1
dare 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
to 1
baskerville 1
hall 1
if 1
she 1
really 1
had 1
been, 1
for 1
a 1
trap 1
would 1
be 1
necessary 1
to 1
take 1
her 1
there, 1
and 1
could 1
not 1
have 1
returned 1
to 1
coombe 1
tracey 1
until 1
the 1
early 1
hours 1
of 1
the 1
morning. 1
such 1
an 1
excursion 1
could 1
not 1
be 1
kept 1
secret. 1
the 1
probability 1
was, 1
therefore, 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
telling 1
the 1
truth, 1
or, 1
at 1
least, 1
a 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
truth. 1
i 1
came 1
away 1
baffled 1
and 1
disheartened. 1
once 1
again 1
i 1
had 1
reached 1
that 1
dead 1
wall 1
which 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
built 1
across 1
every 1
path 1
by 1
which 1
i 1
tried 1
to 1
get 1
at 1
the 1
object 1
of 1
my 1
mission. 1
and 1
yet 1
the 1
more 1
i 1
thought 1
of 1
the 1
lady’s 1
face 1
and 1
of 1
her 1
manner 1
the 1
more 1
i 1
felt 1
that 1
something 1
was 1
being 1
held 1
back 1
from 1
me. 1
why 1
should 1
she 1
turn 1
so 1
pale? 1
why 1
should 1
she 1
fight 1
against 1
every 1
admission 1
until 1
it 1
was 1
forced 1
from 1
her? 1
why 1
should 1
she 1
have 1
been 1
so 1
reticent 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
of 1
the 1
tragedy? 1
surely 1
the 1
explanation 1
of 1
all 1
this 1
could 1
not 1
be 1
as 1
innocent 1
as 1
she 1
would 1
have 1
me 1
believe. 1
for 1
the 1
moment 1
i 1
could 1
proceed 1
no 1
farther 1
in 1
that 1
direction, 1
but 1
must 1
turn 1
back 1
to 1
that 1
other 1
clue 1
which 1
was 1
to 1
be 1
sought 1
for 1
among 1
the 1
stone 1
huts 1
upon 1
the 1
moor. 1
and 1
that 1
was 1
a 1
most 1
vague 1
direction. 1
i 1
realised 1
it 1
as 1
i 1
drove 1
back 1
and 1
noted 1
how 1
hill 1
after 1
hill 1
showed 1
traces 1
of 1
the 1
ancient 1
people. 1
barrymore’s 1
only 1
indication 1
had 1
been 1
that 1
the 1
stranger 1
lived 1
in 1
one 1
of 1
these 1
abandoned 1
huts, 1
and 1
many 1
hundreds 1
of 1
them 1
are 1
scattered 1
throughout 1
the 1
length 1
and 1
breadth 1
of 1
the 1
moor. 1
but 1
i 1
had 1
my 1
own 1
experience 1
for 1
a 1
guide 1
since 1
it 1
had 1
shown 1
me 1
the 1
man 1
himself 1
standing 1
upon 1
the 1
summit 1
of 1
the 1
black 1
tor. 1
that, 1
then, 1
should 1
be 1
the 1
centre 1
of 1
my 1
search. 1
from 1
there 1
i 1
should 1
explore 1
every 1
hut 1
upon 1
the 1
moor 1
until 1
i 1
lighted 1
upon 1
the 1
right 1
one. 1
if 1
this 1
man 1
were 1
inside 1
it 1
i 1
should 1
find 1
out 1
from 1
his 1
own 1
lips, 1
at 1
the 1
point 1
of 1
my 1
revolver 1
if 1
necessary, 1
who 1
he 1
was 1
and 1
why 1
he 1
had 1
dogged 1
us 1
so 1
long. 1
he 1
might 1
slip 1
away 1
from 1
us 1
in 1
the 1
crowd 1
of 1
regent 1
street, 1
but 1
it 1
would 1
puzzle 1
him 1
to 1
do 1
so 1
upon 1
the 1
lonely 1
moor. 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
hand, 1
if 1
i 1
should 1
find 1
the 1
hut 1
and 1
its 1
tenant 1
should 1
not 1
be 1
within 1
it 1
i 1
must 1
remain 1
there, 1
however 1
long 1
the 1
vigil, 1
until 1
he 1
returned. 1
holmes 1
had 1
missed 1
him 1
in 1
london. 1
it 1
would 1
indeed 1
be 1
a 1
triumph 1
for 1
me 1
if 1
i 1
could 1
run 1
him 1
to 1
earth 1
where 1
my 1
master 1
had 1
failed. 1
luck 1
had 1
been 1
against 1
us 1
again 1
and 1
again 1
in 1
this 1
inquiry, 1
but 1
now 1
at 1
last 1
it 1
came 1
to 1
my 1
aid. 1
and 1
the 1
messenger 1
of 1
good 1
fortune 1
was 1
none 1
other 1
than 1
mr. 1
frankland, 1
who 1
was 1
standing, 1
grey-whiskered 1
and 1
red-faced, 1
outside 1
the 1
gate 1
of 1
his 1
garden, 1
which 1
opened 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
highroad 1
along 1
which 1
i 1
travelled. 1
“good-day, 1
dr. 1
watson,” 1
cried 1
he 1
with 1
unwonted 1
good 1
humour, 1
“you 1
must 1
really 1
give 1
your 1
horses 1
a 1
rest 1
and 1
come 1
in 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
glass 1
of 1
wine 1
and 1
to 1
congratulate 1
me.” 1
my 1
feelings 1
towards 1
him 1
were 1
very 1
far 1
from 1
being 1
friendly 1
after 1
what 1
i 1
had 1
heard 1
of 1
his 1
treatment 1
of 1
his 1
daughter, 1
but 1
i 1
was 1
anxious 1
to 1
send 1
perkins 1
and 1
the 1
wagonette 1
home, 1
and 1
the 1
opportunity 1
was 1
a 1
good 1
one. 1
i 1
alighted 1
and 1
sent 1
a 1
message 1
to 1
sir 1
henry 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
walk 1
over 1
in 1
time 1
for 1
dinner. 1
then 1
i 1
followed 1
frankland 1
into 1
his 1
dining-room. 1
“it 1
is 1
a 1
great 1
day 1
for 1
me, 1
sir—one 1
of 1
the 1
red-letter 1
days 1
of 1
my 1
life,” 1
he 1
cried 1
with 1
many 1
chuckles. 1
“i 1
have 1
brought 1
off 1
a 1
double 1
event. 1
i 1
mean 1
to 1
teach 1
them 1
in 1
these 1
parts 1
that 1
law 1
is 1
law, 1
and 1
that 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
man 1
here 1
who 1
does 1
not 1
fear 1
to 1
invoke 1
it. 1
i 1
have 1
established 1
a 1
right 1
of 1
way 1
through 1
the 1
centre 1
of 1
old 1
middleton’s 1
park, 1
slap 1
across 1
it, 1
sir, 1
within 1
a 1
hundred 1
yards 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
front 1
door. 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
of 1
that? 1
we’ll 1
teach 1
these 1
magnates 1
that 1
they 1
cannot 1
ride 1
roughshod 1
over 1
the 1
rights 1
of 1
the 1
commoners, 1
confound 1
them! 1
and 1
i’ve 1
closed 1
the 1
wood 1
where 1
the 1
fernworthy 1
folk 1
used 1
to 1
picnic. 1
these 1
infernal 1
people 1
seem 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
there 1
are 1
no 1
rights 1
of 1
property, 1
and 1
that 1
they 1
can 1
swarm 1
where 1
they 1
like 1
with 1
their 1
papers 1
and 1
their 1
bottles. 1
both 1
cases 1
decided, 1
dr. 1
watson, 1
and 1
both 1
in 1
my 1
favour. 1
i 1
haven’t 1
had 1
such 1
a 1
day 1
since 1
i 1
had 1
sir 1
john 1
morland 1
for 1
trespass 1
because 1
he 1
shot 1
in 1
his 1
own 1
warren.” 1
“how 1
on 1
earth 1
did 1
you 1
do 1
that?” 1
“look 1
it 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
books, 1
sir. 1
it 1
will 1
repay 1
reading—frankland 1
_v_. 1
morland, 1
court 1
of 1
queen’s 1
bench. 1
it 1
cost 1
me 1
£200, 1
but 1
i 1
got 1
my 1
verdict.” 1
“did 1
it 1
do 1
you 1
any 1
good?” 1
“none, 1
sir, 1
none. 1
i 1
am 1
proud 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
no 1
interest 1
in 1
the 1
matter. 1
i 1
act 1
entirely 1
from 1
a 1
sense 1
of 1
public 1
duty. 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
doubt, 1
for 1
example, 1
that 1
the 1
fernworthy 1
people 1
will 1
burn 1
me 1
in 1
effigy 1
tonight. 1
i 1
told 1
the 1
police 1
last 1
time 1
they 1
did 1
it 1
that 1
they 1
should 1
stop 1
these 1
disgraceful 1
exhibitions. 1
the 1
county 1
constabulary 1
is 1
in 1
a 1
scandalous 1
state, 1
sir, 1
and 1
it 1
has 1
not 1
afforded 1
me 1
the 1
protection 1
to 1
which 1
i 1
am 1
entitled. 1
the 1
case 1
of 1
frankland 1
_v_. 1
regina 1
will 1
bring 1
the 1
matter 1
before 1
the 1
attention 1
of 1
the 1
public. 1
i 1
told 1
them 1
that 1
they 1
would 1
have 1
occasion 1
to 1
regret 1
their 1
treatment 1
of 1
me, 1
and 1
already 1
my 1
words 1
have 1
come 1
true.” 1
“how 1
so?” 1
i 1
asked. 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
put 1
on 1
a 1
very 1
knowing 1
expression. 1
“because 1
i 1
could 1
tell 1
them 1
what 1
they 1
are 1
dying 1
to 1
know; 1
but 1
nothing 1
would 1
induce 1
me 1
to 1
help 1
the 1
rascals 1
in 1
any 1
way.” 1
i 1
had 1
been 1
casting 1
round 1
for 1
some 1
excuse 1
by 1
which 1
i 1
could 1
get 1
away 1
from 1
his 1
gossip, 1
but 1
now 1
i 1
began 1
to 1
wish 1
to 1
hear 1
more 1
of 1
it. 1
i 1
had 1
seen 1
enough 1
of 1
the 1
contrary 1
nature 1
of 1
the 1
old 1
sinner 1
to 1
understand 1
that 1
any 1
strong 1
sign 1
of 1
interest 1
would 1
be 1
the 1
surest 1
way 1
to 1
stop 1
his 1
confidences. 1
“some 1
poaching 1
case, 1
no 1
doubt?” 1
said 1
i 1
with 1
an 1
indifferent 1
manner. 1
“ha, 1
ha, 1
my 1
boy, 1
a 1
very 1
much 1
more 1
important 1
matter 1
than 1
that! 1
what 1
about 1
the 1
convict 1
on 1
the 1
moor?” 1
i 1
stared. 1
“you 1
don’t 1
mean 1
that 1
you 1
know 1
where 1
he 1
is?” 1
said 1
i. 1
“i 1
may 1
not 1
know 1
exactly 1
where 1
he 1
is, 1
but 1
i 1
am 1
quite 1
sure 1
that 1
i 1
could 1
help 1
the 1
police 1
to 1
lay 1
their 1
hands 1
on 1
him. 1
has 1
it 1
never 1
struck 1
you 1
that 1
the 1
way 1
to 1
catch 1
that 1
man 1
was 1
to 1
find 1
out 1
where 1
he 1
got 1
his 1
food 1
and 1
so 1
trace 1
it 1
to 1
him?” 1
he 1
certainly 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
getting 1
uncomfortably 1
near 1
the 1
truth. 1
“no 1
doubt,” 1
said 1
i; 1
“but 1
how 1
do 1
you 1
know 1
that 1
he 1
is 1
anywhere 1
upon 1
the 1
moor?” 1
“i 1
know 1
it 1
because 1
i 1
have 1
seen 1
with 1
my 1
own 1
eyes 1
the 1
messenger 1
who 1
takes 1
him 1
his 1
food.” 1
my 1
heart 1
sank 1
for 1
barrymore. 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
serious 1
thing 1
to 1
be 1
in 1
the 1
power 1
of 1
this 1
spiteful 1
old 1
busybody. 1
but 1
his 1
next 1
remark 1
took 1
a 1
weight 1
from 1
my 1
mind. 1
“you’ll 1
be 1
surprised 1
to 1
hear 1
that 1
his 1
food 1
is 1
taken 1
to 1
him 1
by 1
a 1
child. 1
i 1
see 1
him 1
every 1
day 1
through 1
my 1
telescope 1
upon 1
the 1
roof. 1
he 1
passes 1
along 1
the 1
same 1
path 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
hour, 1
and 1
to 1
whom 1
should 1
he 1
be 1
going 1
except 1
to 1
the 1
convict?” 1
here 1
was 1
luck 1
indeed! 1
and 1
yet 1
i 1
suppressed 1
all 1
appearance 1
of 1
interest. 1
a 1
child! 1
barrymore 1
had 1
said 1
that 1
our 1
unknown 1
was 1
supplied 1
by 1
a 1
boy. 1
it 1
was 1
on 1
his 1
track, 1
and 1
not 1
upon 1
the 1
convict’s, 1
that 1
frankland 1
had 1
stumbled. 1
if 1
i 1
could 1
get 1
his 1
knowledge 1
it 1
might 1
save 1
me 1
a 1
long 1
and 1
weary 1
hunt. 1
but 1
incredulity 1
and 1
indifference 1
were 1
evidently 1
my 1
strongest 1
cards. 1
“i 1
should 1
say 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
much 1
more 1
likely 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
son 1
of 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
moorland 1
shepherds 1
taking 1
out 1
his 1
father’s 1
dinner.” 1
the 1
least 1
appearance 1
of 1
opposition 1
struck 1
fire 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
old 1
autocrat. 1
his 1
eyes 1
looked 1
malignantly 1
at 1
me, 1
and 1
his 1
grey 1
whiskers 1
bristled 1
like 1
those 1
of 1
an 1
angry 1
cat. 1
“indeed, 1
sir!” 1
said 1
he, 1
pointing 1
out 1
over 1
the 1
wide-stretching 1
moor. 1
“do 1
you 1
see 1
that 1
black 1
tor 1
over 1
yonder? 1
well, 1
do 1
you 1
see 1
the 1
low 1
hill 1
beyond 1
with 1
the 1
thornbush 1
upon 1
it? 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
stoniest 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
whole 1
moor. 1
is 1
that 1
a 1
place 1
where 1
a 1
shepherd 1
would 1
be 1
likely 1
to 1
take 1
his 1
station? 1
your 1
suggestion, 1
sir, 1
is 1
a 1
most 1
absurd 1
one.” 1
i 1
meekly 1
answered 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
spoken 1
without 1
knowing 1
all 1
the 1
facts. 1
my 1
submission 1
pleased 1
him 1
and 1
led 1
him 1
to 1
further 1
confidences. 1
“you 1
may 1
be 1
sure, 1
sir, 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
very 1
good 1
grounds 1
before 1
i 1
come 1
to 1
an 1
opinion. 1
i 1
have 1
seen 1
the 1
boy 1
again 1
and 1
again 1
with 1
his 1
bundle. 1
every 1
day, 1
and 1
sometimes 1
twice 1
a 1
day, 1
i 1
have 1
been 1
able—but 1
wait 1
a 1
moment, 1
dr. 1
watson. 1
do 1
my 1
eyes 1
deceive 1
me, 1
or 1
is 1
there 1
at 1
the 1
present 1
moment 1
something 1
moving 1
upon 1
that 1
hillside?” 1
it 1
was 1
several 1
miles 1
off, 1
but 1
i 1
could 1
distinctly 1
see 1
a 1
small 1
dark 1
dot 1
against 1
the 1
dull 1
green 1
and 1
grey. 1
“come, 1
sir, 1
come!” 1
cried 1
frankland, 1
rushing 1
upstairs. 1
“you 1
will 1
see 1
with 1
your 1
own 1
eyes 1
and 1
judge 1
for 1
yourself.” 1
the 1
telescope, 1
a 1
formidable 1
instrument 1
mounted 1
upon 1
a 1
tripod, 1
stood 1
upon 1
the 1
flat 1
leads 1
of 1
the 1
house. 1
frankland 1
clapped 1
his 1
eye 1
to 1
it 1
and 1
gave 1
a 1
cry 1
of 1
satisfaction. 1
“quick, 1
dr. 1
watson, 1
quick, 1
before 1
he 1
passes 1
over 1
the 1
hill!” 1
there 1
he 1
was, 1
sure 1
enough, 1
a 1
small 1
urchin 1
with 1
a 1
little 1
bundle 1
upon 1
his 1
shoulder, 1
toiling 1
slowly 1
up 1
the 1
hill. 1
when 1
he 1
reached 1
the 1
crest 1
i 1
saw 1
the 1
ragged 1
uncouth 1
figure 1
outlined 1
for 1
an 1
instant 1
against 1
the 1
cold 1
blue 1
sky. 1
he 1
looked 1
round 1
him 1
with 1
a 1
furtive 1
and 1
stealthy 1
air, 1
as 1
one 1
who 1
dreads 1
pursuit. 1
then 1
he 1
vanished 1
over 1
the 1
hill. 1
“well! 1
am 1
i 1
right?” 1
“certainly, 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
boy 1
who 1
seems 1
to 1
have 1
some 1
secret 1
errand.” 1
“and 1
what 1
the 1
errand 1
is 1
even 1
a 1
county 1
constable 1
could 1
guess. 1
but 1
not 1
one 1
word 1
shall 1
they 1
have 1
from 1
me, 1
and 1
i 1
bind 1
you 1
to 1
secrecy 1
also, 1
dr. 1
watson. 1
not 1
a 1
word! 1
you 1
understand!” 1
“just 1
as 1
you 1
wish.” 1
“they 1
have 1
treated 1
me 1
shamefully—shamefully. 1
when 1
the 1
facts 1
come 1
out 1
in 1
frankland 1
_v_. 1
regina 1
i 1
venture 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
a 1
thrill 1
of 1
indignation 1
will 1
run 1
through 1
the 1
country. 1
nothing 1
would 1
induce 1
me 1
to 1
help 1
the 1
police 1
in 1
any 1
way. 1
for 1
all 1
they 1
cared 1
it 1
might 1
have 1
been 1
me, 1
instead 1
of 1
my 1
effigy, 1
which 1
these 1
rascals 1
burned 1
at 1
the 1
stake. 1
surely 1
you 1
are 1
not 1
going! 1
you 1
will 1
help 1
me 1
to 1
empty 1
the 1
decanter 1
in 1
honour 1
of 1
this 1
great 1
occasion!” 1
but 1
i 1
resisted 1
all 1
his 1
solicitations 1
and 1
succeeded 1
in 1
dissuading 1
him 1
from 1
his 1
announced 1
intention 1
of 1
walking 1
home 1
with 1
me. 1
i 1
kept 1
the 1
road 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
his 1
eye 1
was 1
on 1
me, 1
and 1
then 1
i 1
struck 1
off 1
across 1
the 1
moor 1
and 1
made 1
for 1
the 1
stony 1
hill 1
over 1
which 1
the 1
boy 1
had 1
disappeared. 1
everything 1
was 1
working 1
in 1
my 1
favour, 1
and 1
i 1
swore 1
that 1
it 1
should 1
not 1
be 1
through 1
lack 1
of 1
energy 1
or 1
perseverance 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
miss 1
the 1
chance 1
which 1
fortune 1
had 1
thrown 1
in 1
my 1
way. 1
the 1
sun 1
was 1
already 1
sinking 1
when 1
i 1
reached 1
the 1
summit 1
of 1
the 1
hill, 1
and 1
the 1
long 1
slopes 1
beneath 1
me 1
were 1
all 1
golden-green 1
on 1
one 1
side 1
and 1
grey 1
shadow 1
on 1
the 1
other. 1
a 1
haze 1
lay 1
low 1
upon 1
the 1
farthest 1
sky-line, 1
out 1
of 1
which 1
jutted 1
the 1
fantastic 1
shapes 1
of 1
belliver 1
and 1
vixen 1
tor. 1
over 1
the 1
wide 1
expanse 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
sound 1
and 1
no 1
movement. 1
one 1
great 1
grey 1
bird, 1
a 1
gull 1
or 1
curlew, 1
soared 1
aloft 1
in 1
the 1
blue 1
heaven. 1
he 1
and 1
i 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
only 1
living 1
things 1
between 1
the 1
huge 1
arch 1
of 1
the 1
sky 1
and 1
the 1
desert 1
beneath 1
it. 1
the 1
barren 1
scene, 1
the 1
sense 1
of 1
loneliness, 1
and 1
the 1
mystery 1
and 1
urgency 1
of 1
my 1
task 1
all 1
struck 1
a 1
chill 1
into 1
my 1
heart. 1
the 1
boy 1
was 1
nowhere 1
to 1
be 1
seen. 1
but 1
down 1
beneath 1
me 1
in 1
a 1
cleft 1
of 1
the 1
hills 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
circle 1
of 1
the 1
old 1
stone 1
huts, 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
them 1
there 1
was 1
one 1
which 1
retained 1
sufficient 1
roof 1
to 1
act 1
as 1
a 1
screen 1
against 1
the 1
weather. 1
my 1
heart 1
leaped 1
within 1
me 1
as 1
i 1
saw 1
it. 1
this 1
must 1
be 1
the 1
burrow 1
where 1
the 1
stranger 1
lurked. 1
at 1
last 1
my 1
foot 1
was 1
on 1
the 1
threshold 1
of 1
his 1
hiding 1
place—his 1
secret 1
was 1
within 1
my 1
grasp. 1
as 1
i 1
approached 1
the 1
hut, 1
walking 1
as 1
warily 1
as 1
stapleton 1
would 1
do 1
when 1
with 1
poised 1
net 1
he 1
drew 1
near 1
the 1
settled 1
butterfly, 1
i 1
satisfied 1
myself 1
that 1
the 1
place 1
had 1
indeed 1
been 1
used 1
as 1
a 1
habitation. 1
a 1
vague 1
pathway 1
among 1
the 1
boulders 1
led 1
to 1
the 1
dilapidated 1
opening 1
which 1
served 1
as 1
a 1
door. 1
all 1
was 1
silent 1
within. 1
the 1
unknown 1
might 1
be 1
lurking 1
there, 1
or 1
he 1
might 1
be 1
prowling 1
on 1
the 1
moor. 1
my 1
nerves 1
tingled 1
with 1
the 1
sense 1
of 1
adventure. 1
throwing 1
aside 1
my 1
cigarette, 1
i 1
closed 1
my 1
hand 1
upon 1
the 1
butt 1
of 1
my 1
revolver 1
and, 1
walking 1
swiftly 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
door, 1
i 1
looked 1
in. 1
the 1
place 1
was 1
empty. 1
but 1
there 1
were 1
ample 1
signs 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
not 1
come 1
upon 1
a 1
false 1
scent. 1
this 1
was 1
certainly 1
where 1
the 1
man 1
lived. 1
some 1
blankets 1
rolled 1
in 1
a 1
waterproof 1
lay 1
upon 1
that 1
very 1
stone 1
slab 1
upon 1
which 1
neolithic 1
man 1
had 1
once 1
slumbered. 1
the 1
ashes 1
of 1
a 1
fire 1
were 1
heaped 1
in 1
a 1
rude 1
grate. 1
beside 1
it 1
lay 1
some 1
cooking 1
utensils 1
and 1
a 1
bucket 1
half-full 1
of 1
water. 1
a 1
litter 1
of 1
empty 1
tins 1
showed 1
that 1
the 1
place 1
had 1
been 1
occupied 1
for 1
some 1
time, 1
and 1
i 1
saw, 1
as 1
my 1
eyes 1
became 1
accustomed 1
to 1
the 1
checkered 1
light, 1
a 1
pannikin 1
and 1
a 1
half-full 1
bottle 1
of 1
spirits 1
standing 1
in 1
the 1
corner. 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
hut 1
a 1
flat 1
stone 1
served 1
the 1
purpose 1
of 1
a 1
table, 1
and 1
upon 1
this 1
stood 1
a 1
small 1
cloth 1
bundle—the 1
same, 1
no 1
doubt, 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
seen 1
through 1
the 1
telescope 1
upon 1
the 1
shoulder 1
of 1
the 1
boy. 1
it 1
contained 1
a 1
loaf 1
of 1
bread, 1
a 1
tinned 1
tongue, 1
and 1
two 1
tins 1
of 1
preserved 1
peaches. 1
as 1
i 1
set 1
it 1
down 1
again, 1
after 1
having 1
examined 1
it, 1
my 1
heart 1
leaped 1
to 1
see 1
that 1
beneath 1
it 1
there 1
lay 1
a 1
sheet 1
of 1
paper 1
with 1
writing 1
upon 1
it. 1
i 1
raised 1
it, 1
and 1
this 1
was 1
what 1
i 1
read, 1
roughly 1
scrawled 1
in 1
pencil: 1
“dr. 1
watson 1
has 1
gone 1
to 1
coombe 1
tracey.” 1
for 1
a 1
minute 1
i 1
stood 1
there 1
with 1
the 1
paper 1
in 1
my 1
hands 1
thinking 1
out 1
the 1
meaning 1
of 1
this 1
curt 1
message. 1
it 1
was 1
i, 1
then, 1
and 1
not 1
sir 1
henry, 1
who 1
was 1
being 1
dogged 1
by 1
this 1
secret 1
man. 1
he 1
had 1
not 1
followed 1
me 1
himself, 1
but 1
he 1
had 1
set 1
an 1
agent—the 1
boy, 1
perhaps—upon 1
my 1
track, 1
and 1
this 1
was 1
his 1
report. 1
possibly 1
i 1
had 1
taken 1
no 1
step 1
since 1
i 1
had 1
been 1
upon 1
the 1
moor 1
which 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
observed 1
and 1
reported. 1
always 1
there 1
was 1
this 1
feeling 1
of 1
an 1
unseen 1
force, 1
a 1
fine 1
net 1
drawn 1
round 1
us 1
with 1
infinite 1
skill 1
and 1
delicacy, 1
holding 1
us 1
so 1
lightly 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
only 1
at 1
some 1
supreme 1
moment 1
that 1
one 1
realised 1
that 1
one 1
was 1
indeed 1
entangled 1
in 1
its 1
meshes. 1
if 1
there 1
was 1
one 1
report 1
there 1
might 1
be 1
others, 1
so 1
i 1
looked 1
round 1
the 1
hut 1
in 1
search 1
of 1
them. 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
trace, 1
however, 1
of 1
anything 1
of 1
the 1
kind, 1
nor 1
could 1
i 1
discover 1
any 1
sign 1
which 1
might 1
indicate 1
the 1
character 1
or 1
intentions 1
of 1
the 1
man 1
who 1
lived 1
in 1
this 1
singular 1
place, 1
save 1
that 1
he 1
must 1
be 1
of 1
spartan 1
habits 1
and 1
cared 1
little 1
for 1
the 1
comforts 1
of 1
life. 1
when 1
i 1
thought 1
of 1
the 1
heavy 1
rains 1
and 1
looked 1
at 1
the 1
gaping 1
roof 1
i 1
understood 1
how 1
strong 1
and 1
immutable 1
must 1
be 1
the 1
purpose 1
which 1
had 1
kept 1
him 1
in 1
that 1
inhospitable 1
abode. 1
was 1
he 1
our 1
malignant 1
enemy, 1
or 1
was 1
he 1
by 1
chance 1
our 1
guardian 1
angel? 1
i 1
swore 1
that 1
i 1
would 1
not 1
leave 1
the 1
hut 1
until 1
i 1
knew. 1
outside 1
the 1
sun 1
was 1
sinking 1
low 1
and 1
the 1
west 1
was 1
blazing 1
with 1
scarlet 1
and 1
gold. 1
its 1
reflection 1
was 1
shot 1
back 1
in 1
ruddy 1
patches 1
by 1
the 1
distant 1
pools 1
which 1
lay 1
amid 1
the 1
great 1
grimpen 1
mire. 1
there 1
were 1
the 1
two 1
towers 1
of 1
baskerville 1
hall, 1
and 1
there 1
a 1
distant 1
blur 1
of 1
smoke 1
which 1
marked 1
the 1
village 1
of 1
grimpen. 1
between 1
the 1
two, 1
behind 1
the 1
hill, 1
was 1
the 1
house 1
of 1
the 1
stapletons. 1
all 1
was 1
sweet 1
and 1
mellow 1
and 1
peaceful 1
in 1
the 1
golden 1
evening 1
light, 1
and 1
yet 1
as 1
i 1
looked 1
at 1
them 1
my 1
soul 1
shared 1
none 1
of 1
the 1
peace 1
of 1
nature 1
but 1
quivered 1
at 1
the 1
vagueness 1
and 1
the 1
terror 1
of 1
that 1
interview 1
which 1
every 1
instant 1
was 1
bringing 1
nearer. 1
with 1
tingling 1
nerves 1
but 1
a 1
fixed 1
purpose, 1
i 1
sat 1
in 1
the 1
dark 1
recess 1
of 1
the 1
hut 1
and 1
waited 1
with 1
sombre 1
patience 1
for 1
the 1
coming 1
of 1
its 1
tenant. 1
and 1
then 1
at 1
last 1
i 1
heard 1
him. 1
far 1
away 1
came 1
the 1
sharp 1
clink 1
of 1
a 1
boot 1
striking 1
upon 1
a 1
stone. 1
then 1
another 1
and 1
yet 1
another, 1
coming 1
nearer 1
and 1
nearer. 1
i 1
shrank 1
back 1
into 1
the 1
darkest 1
corner 1
and 1
cocked 1
the 1
pistol 1
in 1
my 1
pocket, 1
determined 1
not 1
to 1
discover 1
myself 1
until 1
i 1
had 1
an 1
opportunity 1
of 1
seeing 1
something 1
of 1
the 1
stranger. 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
long 1
pause 1
which 1
showed 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
stopped. 1
then 1
once 1
more 1
the 1
footsteps 1
approached 1
and 1
a 1
shadow 1
fell 1
across 1
the 1
opening 1
of 1
the 1
hut. 1
“it 1
is 1
a 1
lovely 1
evening, 1
my 1
dear 1
watson,” 1
said 1
a 1
well-known 1
voice. 1
“i 1
really 1
think 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
be 1
more 1
comfortable 1
outside 1
than 1
in.” 1
chapter 1
12. 1
death 1
on 1
the 1
moor 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
or 1
two 1
i 1
sat 1
breathless, 1
hardly 1
able 1
to 1
believe 1
my 1
ears. 1
then 1
my 1
senses 1
and 1
my 1
voice 1
came 1
back 1
to 1
me, 1
while 1
a 1
crushing 1
weight 1
of 1
responsibility 1
seemed 1
in 1
an 1
instant 1
to 1
be 1
lifted 1
from 1
my 1
soul. 1
that 1
cold, 1
incisive, 1
ironical 1
voice 1
could 1
belong 1
to 1
but 1
one 1
man 1
in 1
all 1
the 1
world. 1
“holmes!” 1
i 1
cried—“holmes!” 1
“come 1
out,” 1
said 1
he, 1
“and 1
please 1
be 1
careful 1
with 1
the 1
revolver.” 1
i 1
stooped 1
under 1
the 1
rude 1
lintel, 1
and 1
there 1
he 1
sat 1
upon 1
a 1
stone 1
outside, 1
his 1
grey 1
eyes 1
dancing 1
with 1
amusement 1
as 1
they 1
fell 1
upon 1
my 1
astonished 1
features. 1
he 1
was 1
thin 1
and 1
worn, 1
but 1
clear 1
and 1
alert, 1
his 1
keen 1
face 1
bronzed 1
by 1
the 1
sun 1
and 1
roughened 1
by 1
the 1
wind. 1
in 1
his 1
tweed 1
suit 1
and 1
cloth 1
cap 1
he 1
looked 1
like 1
any 1
other 1
tourist 1
upon 1
the 1
moor, 1
and 1
he 1
had 1
contrived, 1
with 1
that 1
catlike 1
love 1
of 1
personal 1
cleanliness 1
which 1
was 1
one 1
of 1
his 1
characteristics, 1
that 1
his 1
chin 1
should 1
be 1
as 1
smooth 1
and 1
his 1
linen 1
as 1
perfect 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
were 1
in 1
baker 1
street. 1
“i 1
never 1
was 1
more 1
glad 1
to 1
see 1
anyone 1
in 1
my 1
life,” 1
said 1
i 1
as 1
i 1
wrung 1
him 1
by 1
the 1
hand. 1
“or 1
more 1
astonished, 1
eh?” 1
“well, 1
i 1
must 1
confess 1
to 1
it.” 1
“the 1
surprise 1
was 1
not 1
all 1
on 1
one 1
side, 1
i 1
assure 1
you. 1
i 1
had 1
no 1
idea 1
that 1
you 1
had 1
found 1
my 1
occasional 1
retreat, 1
still 1
less 1
that 1
you 1
were 1
inside 1
it, 1
until 1
i 1
was 1
within 1
twenty 1
paces 1
of 1
the 1
door.” 1
“my 1
footprint, 1
i 1
presume?” 1
“no, 1
watson, 1
i 1
fear 1
that 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
undertake 1
to 1
recognize 1
your 1
footprint 1
amid 1
all 1
the 1
footprints 1
of 1
the 1
world. 1
if 1
you 1
seriously 1
desire 1
to 1
deceive 1
me 1
you 1
must 1
change 1
your 1
tobacconist; 1
for 1
when 1
i 1
see 1
the 1
stub 1
of 1
a 1
cigarette 1
marked 1
bradley, 1
oxford 1
street, 1
i 1
know 1
that 1
my 1
friend 1
watson 1
is 1
in 1
the 1
neighbourhood. 1
you 1
will 1
see 1
it 1
there 1
beside 1
the 1
path. 1
you 1
threw 1
it 1
down, 1
no 1
doubt, 1
at 1
that 1
supreme 1
moment 1
when 1
you 1
charged 1
into 1
the 1
empty 1
hut.” 1
“exactly.” 1
“i 1
thought 1
as 1
much—and 1
knowing 1
your 1
admirable 1
tenacity 1
i 1
was 1
convinced 1
that 1
you 1
were 1
sitting 1
in 1
ambush, 1
a 1
weapon 1
within 1
reach, 1
waiting 1
for 1
the 1
tenant 1
to 1
return. 1
so 1
you 1
actually 1
thought 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
the 1
criminal?” 1
“i 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
who 1
you 1
were, 1
but 1
i 1
was 1
determined 1
to 1
find 1
out.” 1
“excellent, 1
watson! 1
and 1
how 1
did 1
you 1
localise 1
me? 1
you 1
saw 1
me, 1
perhaps, 1
on 1
the 1
night 1
of 1
the 1
convict 1
hunt, 1
when 1
i 1
was 1
so 1
imprudent 1
as 1
to 1
allow 1
the 1
moon 1
to 1
rise 1
behind 1
me?” 1
“yes, 1
i 1
saw 1
you 1
then.” 1
“and 1
have 1
no 1
doubt 1
searched 1
all 1
the 1
huts 1
until 1
you 1
came 1
to 1
this 1
one?” 1
“no, 1
your 1
boy 1
had 1
been 1
observed, 1
and 1
that 1
gave 1
me 1
a 1
guide 1
where 1
to 1
look.” 1
“the 1
old 1
gentleman 1
with 1
the 1
telescope, 1
no 1
doubt. 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
make 1
it 1
out 1
when 1
first 1
i 1
saw 1
the 1
light 1
flashing 1
upon 1
the 1
lens.” 1
he 1
rose 1
and 1
peeped 1
into 1
the 1
hut. 1
“ha, 1
i 1
see 1
that 1
cartwright 1
has 1
brought 1
up 1
some 1
supplies. 1
what’s 1
this 1
paper? 1
so 1
you 1
have 1
been 1
to 1
coombe 1
tracey, 1
have 1
you?” 1
“yes.” 1
“to 1
see 1
mrs. 1
laura 1
lyons?” 1
“exactly.” 1
“well 1
done! 1
our 1
researches 1
have 1
evidently 1
been 1
running 1
on 1
parallel 1
lines, 1
and 1
when 1
we 1
unite 1
our 1
results 1
i 1
expect 1
we 1
shall 1
have 1
a 1
fairly 1
full 1
knowledge 1
of 1
the 1
case.” 1
“well, 1
i 1
am 1
glad 1
from 1
my 1
heart 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
here, 1
for 1
indeed 1
the 1
responsibility 1
and 1
the 1
mystery 1
were 1
both 1
becoming 1
too 1
much 1
for 1
my 1
nerves. 1
but 1
how 1
in 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
wonder 1
did 1
you 1
come 1
here, 1
and 1
what 1
have 1
you 1
been 1
doing? 1
i 1
thought 1
that 1
you 1
were 1
in 1
baker 1
street 1
working 1
out 1
that 1
case 1
of 1
blackmailing.” 1
“that 1
was 1
what 1
i 1
wished 1
you 1
to 1
think.” 1
“then 1
you 1
use 1
me, 1
and 1
yet 1
do 1
not 1
trust 1
me!” 1
i 1
cried 1
with 1
some 1
bitterness. 1
“i 1
think 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
deserved 1
better 1
at 1
your 1
hands, 1
holmes.” 1
“my 1
dear 1
fellow, 1
you 1
have 1
been 1
invaluable 1
to 1
me 1
in 1
this 1
as 1
in 1
many 1
other 1
cases, 1
and 1
i 1
beg 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
forgive 1
me 1
if 1
i 1
have 1
seemed 1
to 1
play 1
a 1
trick 1
upon 1
you. 1
in 1
truth, 1
it 1
was 1
partly 1
for 1
your 1
own 1
sake 1
that 1
i 1
did 1
it, 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
my 1
appreciation 1
of 1
the 1
danger 1
which 1
you 1
ran 1
which 1
led 1
me 1
to 1
come 1
down 1
and 1
examine 1
the 1
matter 1
for 1
myself. 1
had 1
i 1
been 1
with 1
sir 1
henry 1
and 1
you 1
it 1
is 1
confident 1
that 1
my 1
point 1
of 1
view 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
the 1
same 1
as 1
yours, 1
and 1
my 1
presence 1
would 1
have 1
warned 1
our 1
very 1
formidable 1
opponents 1
to 1
be 1
on 1
their 1
guard. 1
as 1
it 1
is, 1
i 1
have 1
been 1
able 1
to 1
get 1
about 1
as 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
possibly 1
have 1
done 1
had 1
i 1
been 1
living 1
in 1
the 1
hall, 1
and 1
i 1
remain 1
an 1
unknown 1
factor 1
in 1
the 1
business, 1
ready 1
to 1
throw 1
in 1
all 1
my 1
weight 1
at 1
a 1
critical 1
moment.” 1
“but 1
why 1
keep 1
me 1
in 1
the 1
dark?” 1
“for 1
you 1
to 1
know 1
could 1
not 1
have 1
helped 1
us 1
and 1
might 1
possibly 1
have 1
led 1
to 1
my 1
discovery. 1
you 1
would 1
have 1
wished 1
to 1
tell 1
me 1
something, 1
or 1
in 1
your 1
kindness 1
you 1
would 1
have 1
brought 1
me 1
out 1
some 1
comfort 1
or 1
other, 1
and 1
so 1
an 1
unnecessary 1
risk 1
would 1
be 1
run. 1
i 1
brought 1
cartwright 1
down 1
with 1
me—you 1
remember 1
the 1
little 1
chap 1
at 1
the 1
express 1
office—and 1
he 1
has 1
seen 1
after 1
my 1
simple 1
wants: 1
a 1
loaf 1
of 1
bread 1
and 1
a 1
clean 1
collar. 1
what 1
does 1
man 1
want 1
more? 1
he 1
has 1
given 1
me 1
an 1
extra 1
pair 1
of 1
eyes 1
upon 1
a 1
very 1
active 1
pair 1
of 1
feet, 1
and 1
both 1
have 1
been 1
invaluable.” 1
“then 1
my 1
reports 1
have 1
all 1
been 1
wasted!”—my 1
voice 1
trembled 1
as 1
i 1
recalled 1
the 1
pains 1
and 1
the 1
pride 1
with 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
composed 1
them. 1
holmes 1
took 1
a 1
bundle 1
of 1
papers 1
from 1
his 1
pocket. 1
“here 1
are 1
your 1
reports, 1
my 1
dear 1
fellow, 1
and 1
very 1
well 1
thumbed, 1
i 1
assure 1
you. 1
i 1
made 1
excellent 1
arrangements, 1
and 1
they 1
are 1
only 1
delayed 1
one 1
day 1
upon 1
their 1
way. 1
i 1
must 1
compliment 1
you 1
exceedingly 1
upon 1
the 1
zeal 1
and 1
the 1
intelligence 1
which 1
you 1
have 1
shown 1
over 1
an 1
extraordinarily 1
difficult 1
case.” 1
i 1
was 1
still 1
rather 1
raw 1
over 1
the 1
deception 1
which 1
had 1
been 1
practised 1
upon 1
me, 1
but 1
the 1
warmth 1
of 1
holmes’s 1
praise 1
drove 1
my 1
anger 1
from 1
my 1
mind. 1
i 1
felt 1
also 1
in 1
my 1
heart 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
right 1
in 1
what 1
he 1
said 1
and 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
really 1
best 1
for 1
our 1
purpose 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
not 1
have 1
known 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
upon 1
the 1
moor. 1
“that’s 1
better,” 1
said 1
he, 1
seeing 1
the 1
shadow 1
rise 1
from 1
my 1
face. 1
“and 1
now 1
tell 1
me 1
the 1
result 1
of 1
your 1
visit 1
to 1
mrs. 1
laura 1
lyons—it 1
was 1
not 1
difficult 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
guess 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
to 1
see 1
her 1
that 1
you 1
had 1
gone, 1
for 1
i 1
am 1
already 1
aware 1
that 1
she 1
is 1
the 1
one 1
person 1
in 1
coombe 1
tracey 1
who 1
might 1
be 1
of 1
service 1
to 1
us 1
in 1
the 1
matter. 1
in 1
fact, 1
if 1
you 1
had 1
not 1
gone 1
today 1
it 1
is 1
exceedingly 1
probable 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
have 1
gone 1
tomorrow.” 1
the 1
sun 1
had 1
set 1
and 1
dusk 1
was 1
settling 1
over 1
the 1
moor. 1
the 1
air 1
had 1
turned 1
chill 1
and 1
we 1
withdrew 1
into 1
the 1
hut 1
for 1
warmth. 1
there, 1
sitting 1
together 1
in 1
the 1
twilight, 1
i 1
told 1
holmes 1
of 1
my 1
conversation 1
with 1
the 1
lady. 1
so 1
interested 1
was 1
he 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
to 1
repeat 1
some 1
of 1
it 1
twice 1
before 1
he 1
was 1
satisfied. 1
“this 1
is 1
most 1
important,” 1
said 1
he 1
when 1
i 1
had 1
concluded. 1
“it 1
fills 1
up 1
a 1
gap 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
been 1
unable 1
to 1
bridge 1
in 1
this 1
most 1
complex 1
affair. 1
you 1
are 1
aware, 1
perhaps, 1
that 1
a 1
close 1
intimacy 1
exists 1
between 1
this 1
lady 1
and 1
the 1
man 1
stapleton?” 1
“i 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
of 1
a 1
close 1
intimacy.” 1
“there 1
can 1
be 1
no 1
doubt 1
about 1
the 1
matter. 1
they 1
meet, 1
they 1
write, 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
complete 1
understanding 1
between 1
them. 1
now, 1
this 1
puts 1
a 1
very 1
powerful 1
weapon 1
into 1
our 1
hands. 1
if 1
i 1
could 1
only 1
use 1
it 1
to 1
detach 1
his 1
wife—” 1
“his 1
wife?” 1
“i 1
am 1
giving 1
you 1
some 1
information 1
now, 1
in 1
return 1
for 1
all 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
given 1
me. 1
the 1
lady 1
who 1
has 1
passed 1
here 1
as 1
miss 1
stapleton 1
is 1
in 1
reality 1
his 1
wife.” 1
“good 1
heavens, 1
holmes! 1
are 1
you 1
sure 1
of 1
what 1
you 1
say? 1
how 1
could 1
he 1
have 1
permitted 1
sir 1
henry 1
to 1
fall 1
in 1
love 1
with 1
her?” 1
“sir 1
henry’s 1
falling 1
in 1
love 1
could 1
do 1
no 1
harm 1
to 1
anyone 1
except 1
sir 1
henry. 1
he 1
took 1
particular 1
care 1
that 1
sir 1
henry 1
did 1
not 1
make 1
love 1
to 1
her, 1
as 1
you 1
have 1
yourself 1
observed. 1
i 1
repeat 1
that 1
the 1
lady 1
is 1
his 1
wife 1
and 1
not 1
his 1
sister.” 1
“but 1
why 1
this 1
elaborate 1
deception?” 1
“because 1
he 1
foresaw 1
that 1
she 1
would 1
be 1
very 1
much 1
more 1
useful 1
to 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
character 1
of 1
a 1
free 1
woman.” 1
all 1
my 1
unspoken 1
instincts, 1
my 1
vague 1
suspicions, 1
suddenly 1
took 1
shape 1
and 1
centred 1
upon 1
the 1
naturalist. 1
in 1
that 1
impassive 1
colourless 1
man, 1
with 1
his 1
straw 1
hat 1
and 1
his 1
butterfly-net, 1
i 1
seemed 1
to 1
see 1
something 1
terrible—a 1
creature 1
of 1
infinite 1
patience 1
and 1
craft, 1
with 1
a 1
smiling 1
face 1
and 1
a 1
murderous 1
heart. 1
“it 1
is 1
he, 1
then, 1
who 1
is 1
our 1
enemy—it 1
is 1
he 1
who 1
dogged 1
us 1
in 1
london?” 1
“so 1
i 1
read 1
the 1
riddle.” 1
“and 1
the 1
warning—it 1
must 1
have 1
come 1
from 1
her!” 1
“exactly.” 1
the 1
shape 1
of 1
some 1
monstrous 1
villainy, 1
half 1
seen, 1
half 1
guessed, 1
loomed 1
through 1
the 1
darkness 1
which 1
had 1
girt 1
me 1
so 1
long. 1
“but 1
are 1
you 1
sure 1
of 1
this, 1
holmes? 1
how 1
do 1
you 1
know 1
that 1
the 1
woman 1
is 1
his 1
wife?” 1
“because 1
he 1
so 1
far 1
forgot 1
himself 1
as 1
to 1
tell 1
you 1
a 1
true 1
piece 1
of 1
autobiography 1
upon 1
the 1
occasion 1
when 1
he 1
first 1
met 1
you, 1
and 1
i 1
dare 1
say 1
he 1
has 1
many 1
a 1
time 1
regretted 1
it 1
since. 1
he 1
was 1
once 1
a 1
schoolmaster 1
in 1
the 1
north 1
of 1
england. 1
now, 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
one 1
more 1
easy 1
to 1
trace 1
than 1
a 1
schoolmaster. 1
there 1
are 1
scholastic 1
agencies 1
by 1
which 1
one 1
may 1
identify 1
any 1
man 1
who 1
has 1
been 1
in 1
the 1
profession. 1
a 1
little 1
investigation 1
showed 1
me 1
that 1
a 1
school 1
had 1
come 1
to 1
grief 1
under 1
atrocious 1
circumstances, 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
man 1
who 1
had 1
owned 1
it—the 1
name 1
was 1
different—had 1
disappeared 1
with 1
his 1
wife. 1
the 1
descriptions 1
agreed. 1
when 1
i 1
learned 1
that 1
the 1
missing 1
man 1
was 1
devoted 1
to 1
entomology 1
the 1
identification 1
was 1
complete.” 1
the 1
darkness 1
was 1
rising, 1
but 1
much 1
was 1
still 1
hidden 1
by 1
the 1
shadows. 1
“if 1
this 1
woman 1
is 1
in 1
truth 1
his 1
wife, 1
where 1
does 1
mrs. 1
laura 1
lyons 1
come 1
in?” 1
i 1
asked. 1
“that 1
is 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
points 1
upon 1
which 1
your 1
own 1
researches 1
have 1
shed 1
a 1
light. 1
your 1
interview 1
with 1
the 1
lady 1
has 1
cleared 1
the 1
situation 1
very 1
much. 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
about 1
a 1
projected 1
divorce 1
between 1
herself 1
and 1
her 1
husband. 1
in 1
that 1
case, 1
regarding 1
stapleton 1
as 1
an 1
unmarried 1
man, 1
she 1
counted 1
no 1
doubt 1
upon 1
becoming 1
his 1
wife.” 1
“and 1
when 1
she 1
is 1
undeceived?” 1
“why, 1
then 1
we 1
may 1
find 1
the 1
lady 1
of 1
service. 1
it 1
must 1
be 1
our 1
first 1
duty 1
to 1
see 1
her—both 1
of 1
us—tomorrow. 1
don’t 1
you 1
think, 1
watson, 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
away 1
from 1
your 1
charge 1
rather 1
long? 1
your 1
place 1
should 1
be 1
at 1
baskerville 1
hall.” 1
the 1
last 1
red 1
streaks 1
had 1
faded 1
away 1
in 1
the 1
west 1
and 1
night 1
had 1
settled 1
upon 1
the 1
moor. 1
a 1
few 1
faint 1
stars 1
were 1
gleaming 1
in 1
a 1
violet 1
sky. 1
“one 1
last 1
question, 1
holmes,” 1
i 1
said 1
as 1
i 1
rose. 1
“surely 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
need 1
of 1
secrecy 1
between 1
you 1
and 1
me. 1
what 1
is 1
the 1
meaning 1
of 1
it 1
all? 1
what 1
is 1
he 1
after?” 1
holmes’s 1
voice 1
sank 1
as 1
he 1
answered: 1
“it 1
is 1
murder, 1
watson—refined, 1
cold-blooded, 1
deliberate 1
murder. 1
do 1
not 1
ask 1
me 1
for 1
particulars. 1
my 1
nets 1
are 1
closing 1
upon 1
him, 1
even 1
as 1
his 1
are 1
upon 1
sir 1
henry, 1
and 1
with 1
your 1
help 1
he 1
is 1
already 1
almost 1
at 1
my 1
mercy. 1
there 1
is 1
but 1
one 1
danger 1
which 1
can 1
threaten 1
us. 1
it 1
is 1
that 1
he 1
should 1
strike 1
before 1
we 1
are 1
ready 1
to 1
do 1
so. 1
another 1
day—two 1
at 1
the 1
most—and 1
i 1
have 1
my 1
case 1
complete, 1
but 1
until 1
then 1
guard 1
your 1
charge 1
as 1
closely 1
as 1
ever 1
a 1
fond 1
mother 1
watched 1
her 1
ailing 1
child. 1
your 1
mission 1
today 1
has 1
justified 1
itself, 1
and 1
yet 1
i 1
could 1
almost 1
wish 1
that 1
you 1
had 1
not 1
left 1
his 1
side. 1
hark!” 1
a 1
terrible 1
scream—a 1
prolonged 1
yell 1
of 1
horror 1
and 1
anguish—burst 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
silence 1
of 1
the 1
moor. 1
that 1
frightful 1
cry 1
turned 1
the 1
blood 1
to 1
ice 1
in 1
my 1
veins. 1
“oh, 1
my 1
god!” 1
i 1
gasped. 1
“what 1
is 1
it? 1
what 1
does 1
it 1
mean?” 1
holmes 1
had 1
sprung 1
to 1
his 1
feet, 1
and 1
i 1
saw 1
his 1
dark, 1
athletic 1
outline 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
the 1
hut, 1
his 1
shoulders 1
stooping, 1
his 1
head 1
thrust 1
forward, 1
his 1
face 1
peering 1
into 1
the 1
darkness. 1
“hush!” 1
he 1
whispered. 1
“hush!” 1
the 1
cry 1
had 1
been 1
loud 1
on 1
account 1
of 1
its 1
vehemence, 1
but 1
it 1
had 1
pealed 1
out 1
from 1
somewhere 1
far 1
off 1
on 1
the 1
shadowy 1
plain. 1
now 1
it 1
burst 1
upon 1
our 1
ears, 1
nearer, 1
louder, 1
more 1
urgent 1
than 1
before. 1
“where 1
is 1
it?” 1
holmes 1
whispered; 1
and 1
i 1
knew 1
from 1
the 1
thrill 1
of 1
his 1
voice 1
that 1
he, 1
the 1
man 1
of 1
iron, 1
was 1
shaken 1
to 1
the 1
soul. 1
“where 1
is 1
it, 1
watson?” 1
“there, 1
i 1
think.” 1
i 1
pointed 1
into 1
the 1
darkness. 1
“no, 1
there!” 1
again 1
the 1
agonised 1
cry 1
swept 1
through 1
the 1
silent 1
night, 1
louder 1
and 1
much 1
nearer 1
than 1
ever. 1
and 1
a 1
new 1
sound 1
mingled 1
with 1
it, 1
a 1
deep, 1
muttered 1
rumble, 1
musical 1
and 1
yet 1
menacing, 1
rising 1
and 1
falling 1
like 1
the 1
low, 1
constant 1
murmur 1
of 1
the 1
sea. 1
“the 1
hound!” 1
cried 1
holmes. 1
“come, 1
watson, 1
come! 1
great 1
heavens, 1
if 1
we 1
are 1
too 1
late!” 1
he 1
had 1
started 1
running 1
swiftly 1
over 1
the 1
moor, 1
and 1
i 1
had 1
followed 1
at 1
his 1
heels. 1
but 1
now 1
from 1
somewhere 1
among 1
the 1
broken 1
ground 1
immediately 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
us 1
there 1
came 1
one 1
last 1
despairing 1
yell, 1
and 1
then 1
a 1
dull, 1
heavy 1
thud. 1
we 1
halted 1
and 1
listened. 1
not 1
another 1
sound 1
broke 1
the 1
heavy 1
silence 1
of 1
the 1
windless 1
night. 1
i 1
saw 1
holmes 1
put 1
his 1
hand 1
to 1
his 1
forehead 1
like 1
a 1
man 1
distracted. 1
he 1
stamped 1
his 1
feet 1
upon 1
the 1
ground. 1
“he 1
has 1
beaten 1
us, 1
watson. 1
we 1
are 1
too 1
late.” 1
“no, 1
no, 1
surely 1
not!” 1
“fool 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
to 1
hold 1
my 1
hand. 1
and 1
you, 1
watson, 1
see 1
what 1
comes 1
of 1
abandoning 1
your 1
charge! 1
but, 1
by 1
heaven, 1
if 1
the 1
worst 1
has 1
happened 1
we’ll 1
avenge 1
him!” 1
blindly 1
we 1
ran 1
through 1
the 1
gloom, 1
blundering 1
against 1
boulders, 1
forcing 1
our 1
way 1
through 1
gorse 1
bushes, 1
panting 1
up 1
hills 1
and 1
rushing 1
down 1
slopes, 1
heading 1
always 1
in 1
the 1
direction 1
whence 1
those 1
dreadful 1
sounds 1
had 1
come. 1
at 1
every 1
rise 1
holmes 1
looked 1
eagerly 1
round 1
him, 1
but 1
the 1
shadows 1
were 1
thick 1
upon 1
the 1
moor, 1
and 1
nothing 1
moved 1
upon 1
its 1
dreary 1
face. 1
“can 1
you 1
see 1
anything?” 1
“nothing.” 1
“but, 1
hark, 1
what 1
is 1
that?” 1
a 1
low 1
moan 1
had 1
fallen 1
upon 1
our 1
ears. 1
there 1
it 1
was 1
again 1
upon 1
our 1
left! 1
on 1
that 1
side 1
a 1
ridge 1
of 1
rocks 1
ended 1
in 1
a 1
sheer 1
cliff 1
which 1
overlooked 1
a 1
stone-strewn 1
slope. 1
on 1
its 1
jagged 1
face 1
was 1
spread-eagled 1
some 1
dark, 1
irregular 1
object. 1
as 1
we 1
ran 1
towards 1
it 1
the 1
vague 1
outline 1
hardened 1
into 1
a 1
definite 1
shape. 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
prostrate 1
man 1
face 1
downward 1
upon 1
the 1
ground, 1
the 1
head 1
doubled 1
under 1
him 1
at 1
a 1
horrible 1
angle, 1
the 1
shoulders 1
rounded 1
and 1
the 1
body 1
hunched 1
together 1
as 1
if 1
in 1
the 1
act 1
of 1
throwing 1
a 1
somersault. 1
so 1
grotesque 1
was 1
the 1
attitude 1
that 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
for 1
the 1
instant 1
realise 1
that 1
that 1
moan 1
had 1
been 1
the 1
passing 1
of 1
his 1
soul. 1
not 1
a 1
whisper, 1
not 1
a 1
rustle, 1
rose 1
now 1
from 1
the 1
dark 1
figure 1
over 1
which 1
we 1
stooped. 1
holmes 1
laid 1
his 1
hand 1
upon 1
him 1
and 1
held 1
it 1
up 1
again 1
with 1
an 1
exclamation 1
of 1
horror. 1
the 1
gleam 1
of 1
the 1
match 1
which 1
he 1
struck 1
shone 1
upon 1
his 1
clotted 1
fingers 1
and 1
upon 1
the 1
ghastly 1
pool 1
which 1
widened 1
slowly 1
from 1
the 1
crushed 1
skull 1
of 1
the 1
victim. 1
and 1
it 1
shone 1
upon 1
something 1
else 1
which 1
turned 1
our 1
hearts 1
sick 1
and 1
faint 1
within 1
us—the 1
body 1
of 1
sir 1
henry 1
baskerville! 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
chance 1
of 1
either 1
of 1
us 1
forgetting 1
that 1
peculiar 1
ruddy 1
tweed 1
suit—the 1
very 1
one 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
worn 1
on 1
the 1
first 1
morning 1
that 1
we 1
had 1
seen 1
him 1
in 1
baker 1
street. 1
we 1
caught 1
the 1
one 1
clear 1
glimpse 1
of 1
it, 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
match 1
flickered 1
and 1
went 1
out, 1
even 1
as 1
the 1
hope 1
had 1
gone 1
out 1
of 1
our 1
souls. 1
holmes 1
groaned, 1
and 1
his 1
face 1
glimmered 1
white 1
through 1
the 1
darkness. 1
“the 1
brute! 1
the 1
brute!” 1
i 1
cried 1
with 1
clenched 1
hands. 1
“oh 1
holmes, 1
i 1
shall 1
never 1
forgive 1
myself 1
for 1
having 1
left 1
him 1
to 1
his 1
fate.” 1
“i 1
am 1
more 1
to 1
blame 1
than 1
you, 1
watson. 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
have 1
my 1
case 1
well 1
rounded 1
and 1
complete, 1
i 1
have 1
thrown 1
away 1
the 1
life 1
of 1
my 1
client. 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
greatest 1
blow 1
which 1
has 1
befallen 1
me 1
in 1
my 1
career. 1
but 1
how 1
could 1
i 1
know—how 1
_could_ 1
i 1
know—that 1
he 1
would 1
risk 1
his 1
life 1
alone 1
upon 1
the 1
moor 1
in 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
all 1
my 1
warnings?” 1
“that 1
we 1
should 1
have 1
heard 1
his 1
screams—my 1
god, 1
those 1
screams!—and 1
yet 1
have 1
been 1
unable 1
to 1
save 1
him! 1
where 1
is 1
this 1
brute 1
of 1
a 1
hound 1
which 1
drove 1
him 1
to 1
his 1
death? 1
it 1
may 1
be 1
lurking 1
among 1
these 1
rocks 1
at 1
this 1
instant. 1
and 1
stapleton, 1
where 1
is 1
he? 1
he 1
shall 1
answer 1
for 1
this 1
deed.” 1
“he 1
shall. 1
i 1
will 1
see 1
to 1
that. 1
uncle 1
and 1
nephew 1
have 1
been 1
murdered—the 1
one 1
frightened 1
to 1
death 1
by 1
the 1
very 1
sight 1
of 1
a 1
beast 1
which 1
he 1
thought 1
to 1
be 1
supernatural, 1
the 1
other 1
driven 1
to 1
his 1
end 1
in 1
his 1
wild 1
flight 1
to 1
escape 1
from 1
it. 1
but 1
now 1
we 1
have 1
to 1
prove 1
the 1
connection 1
between 1
the 1
man 1
and 1
the 1
beast. 1
save 1
from 1
what 1
we 1
heard, 1
we 1
cannot 1
even 1
swear 1
to 1
the 1
existence 1
of 1
the 1
latter, 1
since 1
sir 1
henry 1
has 1
evidently 1
died 1
from 1
the 1
fall. 1
but, 1
by 1
heavens, 1
cunning 1
as 1
he 1
is, 1
the 1
fellow 1
shall 1
be 1
in 1
my 1
power 1
before 1
another 1
day 1
is 1
past!” 1
we 1
stood 1
with 1
bitter 1
hearts 1
on 1
either 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
mangled 1
body, 1
overwhelmed 1
by 1
this 1
sudden 1
and 1
irrevocable 1
disaster 1
which 1
had 1
brought 1
all 1
our 1
long 1
and 1
weary 1
labours 1
to 1
so 1
piteous 1
an 1
end. 1
then 1
as 1
the 1
moon 1
rose 1
we 1
climbed 1
to 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
the 1
rocks 1
over 1
which 1
our 1
poor 1
friend 1
had 1
fallen, 1
and 1
from 1
the 1
summit 1
we 1
gazed 1
out 1
over 1
the 1
shadowy 1
moor, 1
half 1
silver 1
and 1
half 1
gloom. 1
far 1
away, 1
miles 1
off, 1
in 1
the 1
direction 1
of 1
grimpen, 1
a 1
single 1
steady 1
yellow 1
light 1
was 1
shining. 1
it 1
could 1
only 1
come 1
from 1
the 1
lonely 1
abode 1
of 1
the 1
stapletons. 1
with 1
a 1
bitter 1
curse 1
i 1
shook 1
my 1
fist 1
at 1
it 1
as 1
i 1
gazed. 1
“why 1
should 1
we 1
not 1
seize 1
him 1
at 1
once?” 1
“our 1
case 1
is 1
not 1
complete. 1
the 1
fellow 1
is 1
wary 1
and 1
cunning 1
to 1
the 1
last 1
degree. 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
what 1
we 1
know, 1
but 1
what 1
we 1
can 1
prove. 1
if 1
we 1
make 1
one 1
false 1
move 1
the 1
villain 1
may 1
escape 1
us 1
yet.” 1
“what 1
can 1
we 1
do?” 1
“there 1
will 1
be 1
plenty 1
for 1
us 1
to 1
do 1
tomorrow. 1
tonight 1
we 1
can 1
only 1
perform 1
the 1
last 1
offices 1
to 1
our 1
poor 1
friend.” 1
together 1
we 1
made 1
our 1
way 1
down 1
the 1
precipitous 1
slope 1
and 1
approached 1
the 1
body, 1
black 1
and 1
clear 1
against 1
the 1
silvered 1
stones. 1
the 1
agony 1
of 1
those 1
contorted 1
limbs 1
struck 1
me 1
with 1
a 1
spasm 1
of 1
pain 1
and 1
blurred 1
my 1
eyes 1
with 1
tears. 1
“we 1
must 1
send 1
for 1
help, 1
holmes! 1
we 1
cannot 1
carry 1
him 1
all 1
the 1
way 1
to 1
the 1
hall. 1
good 1
heavens, 1
are 1
you 1
mad?” 1
he 1
had 1
uttered 1
a 1
cry 1
and 1
bent 1
over 1
the 1
body. 1
now 1
he 1
was 1
dancing 1
and 1
laughing 1
and 1
wringing 1
my 1
hand. 1
could 1
this 1
be 1
my 1
stern, 1
self-contained 1
friend? 1
these 1
were 1
hidden 1
fires, 1
indeed! 1
“a 1
beard! 1
a 1
beard! 1
the 1
man 1
has 1
a 1
beard!” 1
“a 1
beard?” 1
“it 1
is 1
not 1
the 1
baronet—it 1
is—why, 1
it 1
is 1
my 1
neighbour, 1
the 1
convict!” 1
with 1
feverish 1
haste 1
we 1
had 1
turned 1
the 1
body 1
over, 1
and 1
that 1
dripping 1
beard 1
was 1
pointing 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
cold, 1
clear 1
moon. 1
there 1
could 1
be 1
no 1
doubt 1
about 1
the 1
beetling 1
forehead, 1
the 1
sunken 1
animal 1
eyes. 1
it 1
was 1
indeed 1
the 1
same 1
face 1
which 1
had 1
glared 1
upon 1
me 1
in 1
the 1
light 1
of 1
the 1
candle 1
from 1
over 1
the 1
rock—the 1
face 1
of 1
selden, 1
the 1
criminal. 1
then 1
in 1
an 1
instant 1
it 1
was 1
all 1
clear 1
to 1
me. 1
i 1
remembered 1
how 1
the 1
baronet 1
had 1
told 1
me 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
handed 1
his 1
old 1
wardrobe 1
to 1
barrymore. 1
barrymore 1
had 1
passed 1
it 1
on 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
help 1
selden 1
in 1
his 1
escape. 1
boots, 1
shirt, 1
cap—it 1
was 1
all 1
sir 1
henry’s. 1
the 1
tragedy 1
was 1
still 1
black 1
enough, 1
but 1
this 1
man 1
had 1
at 1
least 1
deserved 1
death 1
by 1
the 1
laws 1
of 1
his 1
country. 1
i 1
told 1
holmes 1
how 1
the 1
matter 1
stood, 1
my 1
heart 1
bubbling 1
over 1
with 1
thankfulness 1
and 1
joy. 1
“then 1
the 1
clothes 1
have 1
been 1
the 1
poor 1
devil’s 1
death,” 1
said 1
he. 1
“it 1
is 1
clear 1
enough 1
that 1
the 1
hound 1
has 1
been 1
laid 1
on 1
from 1
some 1
article 1
of 1
sir 1
henry’s—the 1
boot 1
which 1
was 1
abstracted 1
in 1
the 1
hotel, 1
in 1
all 1
probability—and 1
so 1
ran 1
this 1
man 1
down. 1
there 1
is 1
one 1
very 1
singular 1
thing, 1
however: 1
how 1
came 1
selden, 1
in 1
the 1
darkness, 1
to 1
know 1
that 1
the 1
hound 1
was 1
on 1
his 1
trail?” 1
“he 1
heard 1
him.” 1
“to 1
hear 1
a 1
hound 1
upon 1
the 1
moor 1
would 1
not 1
work 1
a 1
hard 1
man 1
like 1
this 1
convict 1
into 1
such 1
a 1
paroxysm 1
of 1
terror 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
risk 1
recapture 1
by 1
screaming 1
wildly 1
for 1
help. 1
by 1
his 1
cries 1
he 1
must 1
have 1
run 1
a 1
long 1
way 1
after 1
he 1
knew 1
the 1
animal 1
was 1
on 1
his 1
track. 1
how 1
did 1
he 1
know?” 1
“a 1
greater 1
mystery 1
to 1
me 1
is 1
why 1
this 1
hound, 1
presuming 1
that 1
all 1
our 1
conjectures 1
are 1
correct—” 1
“i 1
presume 1
nothing.” 1
“well, 1
then, 1
why 1
this 1
hound 1
should 1
be 1
loose 1
tonight. 1
i 1
suppose 1
that 1
it 1
does 1
not 1
always 1
run 1
loose 1
upon 1
the 1
moor. 1
stapleton 1
would 1
not 1
let 1
it 1
go 1
unless 1
he 1
had 1
reason 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
sir 1
henry 1
would 1
be 1
there.” 1
“my 1
difficulty 1
is 1
the 1
more 1
formidable 1
of 1
the 1
two, 1
for 1
i 1
think 1
that 1
we 1
shall 1
very 1
shortly 1
get 1
an 1
explanation 1
of 1
yours, 1
while 1
mine 1
may 1
remain 1
forever 1
a 1
mystery. 1
the 1
question 1
now 1
is, 1
what 1
shall 1
we 1
do 1
with 1
this 1
poor 1
wretch’s 1
body? 1
we 1
cannot 1
leave 1
it 1
here 1
to 1
the 1
foxes 1
and 1
the 1
ravens.” 1
“i 1
suggest 1
that 1
we 1
put 1
it 1
in 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
huts 1
until 1
we 1
can 1
communicate 1
with 1
the 1
police.” 1
“exactly. 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
doubt 1
that 1
you 1
and 1
i 1
could 1
carry 1
it 1
so 1
far. 1
halloa, 1
watson, 1
what’s 1
this? 1
it’s 1
the 1
man 1
himself, 1
by 1
all 1
that’s 1
wonderful 1
and 1
audacious! 1
not 1
a 1
word 1
to 1
show 1
your 1
suspicions—not 1
a 1
word, 1
or 1
my 1
plans 1
crumble 1
to 1
the 1
ground.” 1
a 1
figure 1
was 1
approaching 1
us 1
over 1
the 1
moor, 1
and 1
i 1
saw 1
the 1
dull 1
red 1
glow 1
of 1
a 1
cigar. 1
the 1
moon 1
shone 1
upon 1
him, 1
and 1
i 1
could 1
distinguish 1
the 1
dapper 1
shape 1
and 1
jaunty 1
walk 1
of 1
the 1
naturalist. 1
he 1
stopped 1
when 1
he 1
saw 1
us, 1
and 1
then 1
came 1
on 1
again. 1
“why, 1
dr. 1
watson, 1
that’s 1
not 1
you, 1
is 1
it? 1
you 1
are 1
the 1
last 1
man 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
have 1
expected 1
to 1
see 1
out 1
on 1
the 1
moor 1
at 1
this 1
time 1
of 1
night. 1
but, 1
dear 1
me, 1
what’s 1
this? 1
somebody 1
hurt? 1
not—don’t 1
tell 1
me 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
our 1
friend 1
sir 1
henry!” 1
he 1
hurried 1
past 1
me 1
and 1
stooped 1
over 1
the 1
dead 1
man. 1
i 1
heard 1
a 1
sharp 1
intake 1
of 1
his 1
breath 1
and 1
the 1
cigar 1
fell 1
from 1
his 1
fingers. 1
“who—who’s 1
this?” 1
he 1
stammered. 1
“it 1
is 1
selden, 1
the 1
man 1
who 1
escaped 1
from 1
princetown.” 1
stapleton 1
turned 1
a 1
ghastly 1
face 1
upon 1
us, 1
but 1
by 1
a 1
supreme 1
effort 1
he 1
had 1
overcome 1
his 1
amazement 1
and 1
his 1
disappointment. 1
he 1
looked 1
sharply 1
from 1
holmes 1
to 1
me. 1
“dear 1
me! 1
what 1
a 1
very 1
shocking 1
affair! 1
how 1
did 1
he 1
die?” 1
“he 1
appears 1
to 1
have 1
broken 1
his 1
neck 1
by 1
falling 1
over 1
these 1
rocks. 1
my 1
friend 1
and 1
i 1
were 1
strolling 1
on 1
the 1
moor 1
when 1
we 1
heard 1
a 1
cry.” 1
“i 1
heard 1
a 1
cry 1
also. 1
that 1
was 1
what 1
brought 1
me 1
out. 1
i 1
was 1
uneasy 1
about 1
sir 1
henry.” 1
“why 1
about 1
sir 1
henry 1
in 1
particular?” 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
help 1
asking. 1
“because 1
i 1
had 1
suggested 1
that 1
he 1
should 1
come 1
over. 1
when 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
come 1
i 1
was 1
surprised, 1
and 1
i 1
naturally 1
became 1
alarmed 1
for 1
his 1
safety 1
when 1
i 1
heard 1
cries 1
upon 1
the 1
moor. 1
by 1
the 1
way”—his 1
eyes 1
darted 1
again 1
from 1
my 1
face 1
to 1
holmes’s—“did 1
you 1
hear 1
anything 1
else 1
besides 1
a 1
cry?” 1
“no,” 1
said 1
holmes; 1
“did 1
you?” 1
“no.” 1
“what 1
do 1
you 1
mean, 1
then?” 1
“oh, 1
you 1
know 1
the 1
stories 1
that 1
the 1
peasants 1
tell 1
about 1
a 1
phantom 1
hound, 1
and 1
so 1
on. 1
it 1
is 1
said 1
to 1
be 1
heard 1
at 1
night 1
upon 1
the 1
moor. 1
i 1
was 1
wondering 1
if 1
there 1
were 1
any 1
evidence 1
of 1
such 1
a 1
sound 1
tonight.” 1
“we 1
heard 1
nothing 1
of 1
the 1
kind,” 1
said 1
i. 1
“and 1
what 1
is 1
your 1
theory 1
of 1
this 1
poor 1
fellow’s 1
death?” 1
“i 1
have 1
no 1
doubt 1
that 1
anxiety 1
and 1
exposure 1
have 1
driven 1
him 1
off 1
his 1
head. 1
he 1
has 1
rushed 1
about 1
the 1
moor 1
in 1
a 1
crazy 1
state 1
and 1
eventually 1
fallen 1
over 1
here 1
and 1
broken 1
his 1
neck.” 1
“that 1
seems 1
the 1
most 1
reasonable 1
theory,” 1
said 1
stapleton, 1
and 1
he 1
gave 1
a 1
sigh 1
which 1
i 1
took 1
to 1
indicate 1
his 1
relief. 1
“what 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
about 1
it, 1
mr. 1
sherlock 1
holmes?” 1
my 1
friend 1
bowed 1
his 1
compliments. 1
“you 1
are 1
quick 1
at 1
identification,” 1
said 1
he. 1
“we 1
have 1
been 1
expecting 1
you 1
in 1
these 1
parts 1
since 1
dr. 1
watson 1
came 1
down. 1
you 1
are 1
in 1
time 1
to 1
see 1
a 1
tragedy.” 1
“yes, 1
indeed. 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
doubt 1
that 1
my 1
friend’s 1
explanation 1
will 1
cover 1
the 1
facts. 1
i 1
will 1
take 1
an 1
unpleasant 1
remembrance 1
back 1
to 1
london 1
with 1
me 1
tomorrow.” 1
“oh, 1
you 1
return 1
tomorrow?” 1
“that 1
is 1
my 1
intention.” 1
“i 1
hope 1
your 1
visit 1
has 1
cast 1
some 1
light 1
upon 1
those 1
occurrences 1
which 1
have 1
puzzled 1
us?” 1
holmes 1
shrugged 1
his 1
shoulders. 1
“one 1
cannot 1
always 1
have 1
the 1
success 1
for 1
which 1
one 1
hopes. 1
an 1
investigator 1
needs 1
facts 1
and 1
not 1
legends 1
or 1
rumours. 1
it 1
has 1
not 1
been 1
a 1
satisfactory 1
case.” 1
my 1
friend 1
spoke 1
in 1
his 1
frankest 1
and 1
most 1
unconcerned 1
manner. 1
stapleton 1
still 1
looked 1
hard 1
at 1
him. 1
then 1
he 1
turned 1
to 1
me. 1
“i 1
would 1
suggest 1
carrying 1
this 1
poor 1
fellow 1
to 1
my 1
house, 1
but 1
it 1
would 1
give 1
my 1
sister 1
such 1
a 1
fright 1
that 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
feel 1
justified 1
in 1
doing 1
it. 1
i 1
think 1
that 1
if 1
we 1
put 1
something 1
over 1
his 1
face 1
he 1
will 1
be 1
safe 1
until 1
morning.” 1
and 1
so 1
it 1
was 1
arranged. 1
resisting 1
stapleton’s 1
offer 1
of 1
hospitality, 1
holmes 1
and 1
i 1
set 1
off 1
to 1
baskerville 1
hall, 1
leaving 1
the 1
naturalist 1
to 1
return 1
alone. 1
looking 1
back 1
we 1
saw 1
the 1
figure 1
moving 1
slowly 1
away 1
over 1
the 1
broad 1
moor, 1
and 1
behind 1
him 1
that 1
one 1
black 1
smudge 1
on 1
the 1
silvered 1
slope 1
which 1
showed 1
where 1
the 1
man 1
was 1
lying 1
who 1
had 1
come 1
so 1
horribly 1
to 1
his 1
end. 1
“we’re 1
at 1
close 1
grips 1
at 1
last,” 1
said 1
holmes 1
as 1
we 1
walked 1
together 1
across 1
the 1
moor. 1
“what 1
a 1
nerve 1
the 1
fellow 1
has! 1
how 1
he 1
pulled 1
himself 1
together 1
in 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
what 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
a 1
paralyzing 1
shock 1
when 1
he 1
found 1
that 1
the 1
wrong 1
man 1
had 1
fallen 1
a 1
victim 1
to 1
his 1
plot. 1
i 1
told 1
you 1
in 1
london, 1
watson, 1
and 1
i 1
tell 1
you 1
now 1
again, 1
that 1
we 1
have 1
never 1
had 1
a 1
foeman 1
more 1
worthy 1
of 1
our 1
steel.” 1
“i 1
am 1
sorry 1
that 1
he 1
has 1
seen 1
you.” 1
“and 1
so 1
was 1
i 1
at 1
first. 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
getting 1
out 1
of 1
it.” 1
“what 1
effect 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
it 1
will 1
have 1
upon 1
his 1
plans 1
now 1
that 1
he 1
knows 1
you 1
are 1
here?” 1
“it 1
may 1
cause 1
him 1
to 1
be 1
more 1
cautious, 1
or 1
it 1
may 1
drive 1
him 1
to 1
desperate 1
measures 1
at 1
once. 1
like 1
most 1
clever 1
criminals, 1
he 1
may 1
be 1
too 1
confident 1
in 1
his 1
own 1
cleverness 1
and 1
imagine 1
that 1
he 1
has 1
completely 1
deceived 1
us.” 1
“why 1
should 1
we 1
not 1
arrest 1
him 1
at 1
once?” 1
“my 1
dear 1
watson, 1
you 1
were 1
born 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
man 1
of 1
action. 1
your 1
instinct 1
is 1
always 1
to 1
do 1
something 1
energetic. 1
but 1
supposing, 1
for 1
argument’s 1
sake, 1
that 1
we 1
had 1
him 1
arrested 1
tonight, 1
what 1
on 1
earth 1
the 1
better 1
off 1
should 1
we 1
be 1
for 1
that? 1
we 1
could 1
prove 1
nothing 1
against 1
him. 1
there’s 1
the 1
devilish 1
cunning 1
of 1
it! 1
if 1
he 1
were 1
acting 1
through 1
a 1
human 1
agent 1
we 1
could 1
get 1
some 1
evidence, 1
but 1
if 1
we 1
were 1
to 1
drag 1
this 1
great 1
dog 1
to 1
the 1
light 1
of 1
day 1
it 1
would 1
not 1
help 1
us 1
in 1
putting 1
a 1
rope 1
round 1
the 1
neck 1
of 1
its 1
master.” 1
“surely 1
we 1
have 1
a 1
case.” 1
“not 1
a 1
shadow 1
of 1
one—only 1
surmise 1
and 1
conjecture. 1
we 1
should 1
be 1
laughed 1
out 1
of 1
court 1
if 1
we 1
came 1
with 1
such 1
a 1
story 1
and 1
such 1
evidence.” 1
“there 1
is 1
sir 1
charles’s 1
death.” 1
“found 1
dead 1
without 1
a 1
mark 1
upon 1
him. 1
you 1
and 1
i 1
know 1
that 1
he 1
died 1
of 1
sheer 1
fright, 1
and 1
we 1
know 1
also 1
what 1
frightened 1
him, 1
but 1
how 1
are 1
we 1
to 1
get 1
twelve 1
stolid 1
jurymen 1
to 1
know 1
it? 1
what 1
signs 1
are 1
there 1
of 1
a 1
hound? 1
where 1
are 1
the 1
marks 1
of 1
its 1
fangs? 1
of 1
course 1
we 1
know 1
that 1
a 1
hound 1
does 1
not 1
bite 1
a 1
dead 1
body 1
and 1
that 1
sir 1
charles 1
was 1
dead 1
before 1
ever 1
the 1
brute 1
overtook 1
him. 1
but 1
we 1
have 1
to 1
prove 1
all 1
this, 1
and 1
we 1
are 1
not 1
in 1
a 1
position 1
to 1
do 1
it.” 1
“well, 1
then, 1
tonight?” 1
“we 1
are 1
not 1
much 1
better 1
off 1
tonight. 1
again, 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
direct 1
connection 1
between 1
the 1
hound 1
and 1
the 1
man’s 1
death. 1
we 1
never 1
saw 1
the 1
hound. 1
we 1
heard 1
it, 1
but 1
we 1
could 1
not 1
prove 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
running 1
upon 1
this 1
man’s 1
trail. 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
complete 1
absence 1
of 1
motive. 1
no, 1
my 1
dear 1
fellow; 1
we 1
must 1
reconcile 1
ourselves 1
to 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
we 1
have 1
no 1
case 1
at 1
present, 1
and 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
worth 1
our 1
while 1
to 1
run 1
any 1
risk 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
establish 1
one.” 1
“and 1
how 1
do 1
you 1
propose 1
to 1
do 1
so?” 1
“i 1
have 1
great 1
hopes 1
of 1
what 1
mrs. 1
laura 1
lyons 1
may 1
do 1
for 1
us 1
when 1
the 1
position 1
of 1
affairs 1
is 1
made 1
clear 1
to 1
her. 1
and 1
i 1
have 1
my 1
own 1
plan 1
as 1
well. 1
sufficient 1
for 1
tomorrow 1
is 1
the 1
evil 1
thereof; 1
but 1
i 1
hope 1
before 1
the 1
day 1
is 1
past 1
to 1
have 1
the 1
upper 1
hand 1
at 1
last.” 1
i 1
could 1
draw 1
nothing 1
further 1
from 1
him, 1
and 1
he 1
walked, 1
lost 1
in 1
thought, 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
the 1
baskerville 1
gates. 1
“are 1
you 1
coming 1
up?” 1
“yes; 1
i 1
see 1
no 1
reason 1
for 1
further 1
concealment. 1
but 1
one 1
last 1
word, 1
watson. 1
say 1
nothing 1
of 1
the 1
hound 1
to 1
sir 1
henry. 1
let 1
him 1
think 1
that 1
selden’s 1
death 1
was 1
as 1
stapleton 1
would 1
have 1
us 1
believe. 1
he 1
will 1
have 1
a 1
better 1
nerve 1
for 1
the 1
ordeal 1
which 1
he 1
will 1
have 1
to 1
undergo 1
tomorrow, 1
when 1
he 1
is 1
engaged, 1
if 1
i 1
remember 1
your 1
report 1
aright, 1
to 1
dine 1
with 1
these 1
people.” 1
“and 1
so 1
am 1
i.” 1
“then 1
you 1
must 1
excuse 1
yourself 1
and 1
he 1
must 1
go 1
alone. 1
that 1
will 1
be 1
easily 1
arranged. 1
and 1
now, 1
if 1
we 1
are 1
too 1
late 1
for 1
dinner, 1
i 1
think 1
that 1
we 1
are 1
both 1
ready 1
for 1
our 1
suppers.” 1
chapter 1
13. 1
fixing 1
the 1
nets 1
sir 1
henry 1
was 1
more 1
pleased 1
than 1
surprised 1
to 1
see 1
sherlock 1
holmes, 1
for 1
he 1
had 1
for 1
some 1
days 1
been 1
expecting 1
that 1
recent 1
events 1
would 1
bring 1
him 1
down 1
from 1
london. 1
he 1
did 1
raise 1
his 1
eyebrows, 1
however, 1
when 1
he 1
found 1
that 1
my 1
friend 1
had 1
neither 1
any 1
luggage 1
nor 1
any 1
explanations 1
for 1
its 1
absence. 1
between 1
us 1
we 1
soon 1
supplied 1
his 1
wants, 1
and 1
then 1
over 1
a 1
belated 1
supper 1
we 1
explained 1
to 1
the 1
baronet 1
as 1
much 1
of 1
our 1
experience 1
as 1
it 1
seemed 1
desirable 1
that 1
he 1
should 1
know. 1
but 1
first 1
i 1
had 1
the 1
unpleasant 1
duty 1
of 1
breaking 1
the 1
news 1
to 1
barrymore 1
and 1
his 1
wife. 1
to 1
him 1
it 1
may 1
have 1
been 1
an 1
unmitigated 1
relief, 1
but 1
she 1
wept 1
bitterly 1
in 1
her 1
apron. 1
to 1
all 1
the 1
world 1
he 1
was 1
the 1
man 1
of 1
violence, 1
half 1
animal 1
and 1
half 1
demon; 1
but 1
to 1
her 1
he 1
always 1
remained 1
the 1
little 1
wilful 1
boy 1
of 1
her 1
own 1
girlhood, 1
the 1
child 1
who 1
had 1
clung 1
to 1
her 1
hand. 1
evil 1
indeed 1
is 1
the 1
man 1
who 1
has 1
not 1
one 1
woman 1
to 1
mourn 1
him. 1
“i’ve 1
been 1
moping 1
in 1
the 1
house 1
all 1
day 1
since 1
watson 1
went 1
off 1
in 1
the 1
morning,” 1
said 1
the 1
baronet. 1
“i 1
guess 1
i 1
should 1
have 1
some 1
credit, 1
for 1
i 1
have 1
kept 1
my 1
promise. 1
if 1
i 1
hadn’t 1
sworn 1
not 1
to 1
go 1
about 1
alone 1
i 1
might 1
have 1
had 1
a 1
more 1
lively 1
evening, 1
for 1
i 1
had 1
a 1
message 1
from 1
stapleton 1
asking 1
me 1
over 1
there.” 1
“i 1
have 1
no 1
doubt 1
that 1
you 1
would 1
have 1
had 1
a 1
more 1
lively 1
evening,” 1
said 1
holmes 1
drily. 1
“by 1
the 1
way, 1
i 1
don’t 1
suppose 1
you 1
appreciate 1
that 1
we 1
have 1
been 1
mourning 1
over 1
you 1
as 1
having 1
broken 1
your 1
neck?” 1
sir 1
henry 1
opened 1
his 1
eyes. 1
“how 1
was 1
that?” 1
“this 1
poor 1
wretch 1
was 1
dressed 1
in 1
your 1
clothes. 1
i 1
fear 1
your 1
servant 1
who 1
gave 1
them 1
to 1
him 1
may 1
get 1
into 1
trouble 1
with 1
the 1
police.” 1
“that 1
is 1
unlikely. 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
mark 1
on 1
any 1
of 1
them, 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
i 1
know.” 1
“that’s 1
lucky 1
for 1
him—in 1
fact, 1
it’s 1
lucky 1
for 1
all 1
of 1
you, 1
since 1
you 1
are 1
all 1
on 1
the 1
wrong 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
law 1
in 1
this 1
matter. 1
i 1
am 1
not 1
sure 1
that 1
as 1
a 1
conscientious 1
detective 1
my 1
first 1
duty 1
is 1
not 1
to 1
arrest 1
the 1
whole 1
household. 1
watson’s 1
reports 1
are 1
most 1
incriminating 1
documents.” 1
“but 1
how 1
about 1
the 1
case?” 1
asked 1
the 1
baronet. 1
“have 1
you 1
made 1
anything 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
tangle? 1
i 1
don’t 1
know 1
that 1
watson 1
and 1
i 1
are 1
much 1
the 1
wiser 1
since 1
we 1
came 1
down.” 1
“i 1
think 1
that 1
i 1
shall 1
be 1
in 1
a 1
position 1
to 1
make 1
the 1
situation 1
rather 1
more 1
clear 1
to 1
you 1
before 1
long. 1
it 1
has 1
been 1
an 1
exceedingly 1
difficult 1
and 1
most 1
complicated 1
business. 1
there 1
are 1
several 1
points 1
upon 1
which 1
we 1
still 1
want 1
light—but 1
it 1
is 1
coming 1
all 1
the 1
same.” 1
“we’ve 1
had 1
one 1
experience, 1
as 1
watson 1
has 1
no 1
doubt 1
told 1
you. 1
we 1
heard 1
the 1
hound 1
on 1
the 1
moor, 1
so 1
i 1
can 1
swear 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
all 1
empty 1
superstition. 1
i 1
had 1
something 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
dogs 1
when 1
i 1
was 1
out 1
west, 1
and 1
i 1
know 1
one 1
when 1
i 1
hear 1
one. 1
if 1
you 1
can 1
muzzle 1
that 1
one 1
and 1
put 1
him 1
on 1
a 1
chain 1
i’ll 1
be 1
ready 1
to 1
swear 1
you 1
are 1
the 1
greatest 1
detective 1
of 1
all 1
time.” 1
“i 1
think 1
i 1
will 1
muzzle 1
him 1
and 1
chain 1
him 1
all 1
right 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
give 1
me 1
your 1
help.” 1
“whatever 1
you 1
tell 1
me 1
to 1
do 1
i 1
will 1
do.” 1
“very 1
good; 1
and 1
i 1
will 1
ask 1
you 1
also 1
to 1
do 1
it 1
blindly, 1
without 1
always 1
asking 1
the 1
reason.” 1
“just 1
as 1
you 1
like.” 1
“if 1
you 1
will 1
do 1
this 1
i 1
think 1
the 1
chances 1
are 1
that 1
our 1
little 1
problem 1
will 1
soon 1
be 1
solved. 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
doubt—” 1
he 1
stopped 1
suddenly 1
and 1
stared 1
fixedly 1
up 1
over 1
my 1
head 1
into 1
the 1
air. 1
the 1
lamp 1
beat 1
upon 1
his 1
face, 1
and 1
so 1
intent 1
was 1
it 1
and 1
so 1
still 1
that 1
it 1
might 1
have 1
been 1
that 1
of 1
a 1
clear-cut 1
classical 1
statue, 1
a 1
personification 1
of 1
alertness 1
and 1
expectation. 1
“what 1
is 1
it?” 1
we 1
both 1
cried. 1
i 1
could 1
see 1
as 1
he 1
looked 1
down 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
repressing 1
some 1
internal 1
emotion. 1
his 1
features 1
were 1
still 1
composed, 1
but 1
his 1
eyes 1
shone 1
with 1
amused 1
exultation. 1
“excuse 1
the 1
admiration 1
of 1
a 1
connoisseur,” 1
said 1
he 1
as 1
he 1
waved 1
his 1
hand 1
towards 1
the 1
line 1
of 1
portraits 1
which 1
covered 1
the 1
opposite 1
wall. 1
“watson 1
won’t 1
allow 1
that 1
i 1
know 1
anything 1
of 1
art 1
but 1
that 1
is 1
mere 1
jealousy 1
because 1
our 1
views 1
upon 1
the 1
subject 1
differ. 1
now, 1
these 1
are 1
a 1
really 1
very 1
fine 1
series 1
of 1
portraits.” 1
“well, 1
i’m 1
glad 1
to 1
hear 1
you 1
say 1
so,” 1
said 1
sir 1
henry, 1
glancing 1
with 1
some 1
surprise 1
at 1
my 1
friend. 1
“i 1
don’t 1
pretend 1
to 1
know 1
much 1
about 1
these 1
things, 1
and 1
i’d 1
be 1
a 1
better 1
judge 1
of 1
a 1
horse 1
or 1
a 1
steer 1
than 1
of 1
a 1
picture. 1
i 1
didn’t 1
know 1
that 1
you 1
found 1
time 1
for 1
such 1
things.” 1
“i 1
know 1
what 1
is 1
good 1
when 1
i 1
see 1
it, 1
and 1
i 1
see 1
it 1
now. 1
that’s 1
a 1
kneller, 1
i’ll 1
swear, 1
that 1
lady 1
in 1
the 1
blue 1
silk 1
over 1
yonder, 1
and 1
the 1
stout 1
gentleman 1
with 1
the 1
wig 1
ought 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
reynolds. 1
they 1
are 1
all 1
family 1
portraits, 1
i 1
presume?” 1
“every 1
one.” 1
“do 1
you 1
know 1
the 1
names?” 1
“barrymore 1
has 1
been 1
coaching 1
me 1
in 1
them, 1
and 1
i 1
think 1
i 1
can 1
say 1
my 1
lessons 1
fairly 1
well.” 1
“who 1
is 1
the 1
gentleman 1
with 1
the 1
telescope?” 1
“that 1
is 1
rear-admiral 1
baskerville, 1
who 1
served 1
under 1
rodney 1
in 1
the 1
west 1
indies. 1
the 1
man 1
with 1
the 1
blue 1
coat 1
and 1
the 1
roll 1
of 1
paper 1
is 1
sir 1
william 1
baskerville, 1
who 1
was 1
chairman 1
of 1
committees 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
of 1
commons 1
under 1
pitt.” 1
“and 1
this 1
cavalier 1
opposite 1
to 1
me—the 1
one 1
with 1
the 1
black 1
velvet 1
and 1
the 1
lace?” 1
“ah, 1
you 1
have 1
a 1
right 1
to 1
know 1
about 1
him. 1
that 1
is 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
mischief, 1
the 1
wicked 1
hugo, 1
who 1
started 1
the 1
hound 1
of 1
the 1
baskervilles. 1
we’re 1
not 1
likely 1
to 1
forget 1
him.” 1
i 1
gazed 1
with 1
interest 1
and 1
some 1
surprise 1
upon 1
the 1
portrait. 1
“dear 1
me!” 1
said 1
holmes, 1
“he 1
seems 1
a 1
quiet, 1
meek-mannered 1
man 1
enough, 1
but 1
i 1
dare 1
say 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
lurking 1
devil 1
in 1
his 1
eyes. 1
i 1
had 1
pictured 1
him 1
as 1
a 1
more 1
robust 1
and 1
ruffianly 1
person.” 1
“there’s 1
no 1
doubt 1
about 1
the 1
authenticity, 1
for 1
the 1
name 1
and 1
the 1
date, 1
1647, 1
are 1
on 1
the 1
back 1
of 1
the 1
canvas.” 1
holmes 1
said 1
little 1
more, 1
but 1
the 1
picture 1
of 1
the 1
old 1
roysterer 1
seemed 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
fascination 1
for 1
him, 1
and 1
his 1
eyes 1
were 1
continually 1
fixed 1
upon 1
it 1
during 1
supper. 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
until 1
later, 1
when 1
sir 1
henry 1
had 1
gone 1
to 1
his 1
room, 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
able 1
to 1
follow 1
the 1
trend 1
of 1
his 1
thoughts. 1
he 1
led 1
me 1
back 1
into 1
the 1
banqueting-hall, 1
his 1
bedroom 1
candle 1
in 1
his 1
hand, 1
and 1
he 1
held 1
it 1
up 1
against 1
the 1
time-stained 1
portrait 1
on 1
the 1
wall. 1
“do 1
you 1
see 1
anything 1
there?” 1
i 1
looked 1
at 1
the 1
broad 1
plumed 1
hat, 1
the 1
curling 1
love-locks, 1
the 1
white 1
lace 1
collar, 1
and 1
the 1
straight, 1
severe 1
face 1
which 1
was 1
framed 1
between 1
them. 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
a 1
brutal 1
countenance, 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
prim, 1
hard, 1
and 1
stern, 1
with 1
a 1
firm-set, 1
thin-lipped 1
mouth, 1
and 1
a 1
coldly 1
intolerant 1
eye. 1
“is 1
it 1
like 1
anyone 1
you 1
know?” 1
“there 1
is 1
something 1
of 1
sir 1
henry 1
about 1
the 1
jaw.” 1
“just 1
a 1
suggestion, 1
perhaps. 1
but 1
wait 1
an 1
instant!” 1
he 1
stood 1
upon 1
a 1
chair, 1
and, 1
holding 1
up 1
the 1
light 1
in 1
his 1
left 1
hand, 1
he 1
curved 1
his 1
right 1
arm 1
over 1
the 1
broad 1
hat 1
and 1
round 1
the 1
long 1
ringlets. 1
“good 1
heavens!” 1
i 1
cried 1
in 1
amazement. 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
stapleton 1
had 1
sprung 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
canvas. 1
“ha, 1
you 1
see 1
it 1
now. 1
my 1
eyes 1
have 1
been 1
trained 1
to 1
examine 1
faces 1
and 1
not 1
their 1
trimmings. 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
first 1
quality 1
of 1
a 1
criminal 1
investigator 1
that 1
he 1
should 1
see 1
through 1
a 1
disguise.” 1
“but 1
this 1
is 1
marvellous. 1
it 1
might 1
be 1
his 1
portrait.” 1
