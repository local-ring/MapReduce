of 1
the 1
bitterns.” 1
“it’s 1
the 1
weirdest, 1
strangest 1
thing 1
that 1
ever 1
i 1
heard 1
in 1
my 1
life.” 1
“yes, 1
it’s 1
rather 1
an 1
uncanny 1
place 1
altogether. 1
look 1
at 1
the 1
hillside 1
yonder. 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
make 1
of 1
those?” 1
the 1
whole 1
steep 1
slope 1
was 1
covered 1
with 1
grey 1
circular 1
rings 1
of 1
stone, 1
a 1
score 1
of 1
them 1
at 1
least. 1
“what 1
are 1
they? 1
sheep-pens?” 1
“no, 1
they 1
are 1
the 1
homes 1
of 1
our 1
worthy 1
ancestors. 1
prehistoric 1
man 1
lived 1
thickly 1
on 1
the 1
moor, 1
and 1
as 1
no 1
one 1
in 1
particular 1
has 1
lived 1
there 1
since, 1
we 1
find 1
all 1
his 1
little 1
arrangements 1
exactly 1
as 1
he 1
left 1
them. 1
these 1
are 1
his 1
wigwams 1
with 1
the 1
roofs 1
off. 1
you 1
can 1
even 1
see 1
his 1
hearth 1
and 1
his 1
couch 1
if 1
you 1
have 1
the 1
curiosity 1
to 1
go 1
inside. 1
“but 1
it 1
is 1
quite 1
a 1
town. 1
when 1
was 1
it 1
inhabited?” 1
“neolithic 1
man—no 1
date.” 1
“what 1
did 1
he 1
do?” 1
“he 1
grazed 1
his 1
cattle 1
on 1
these 1
slopes, 1
and 1
he 1
learned 1
to 1
dig 1
for 1
tin 1
when 1
the 1
bronze 1
sword 1
began 1
to 1
supersede 1
the 1
stone 1
axe. 1
look 1
at 1
the 1
great 1
trench 1
in 1
the 1
opposite 1
hill. 1
that 1
is 1
his 1
mark. 1
yes, 1
you 1
will 1
find 1
some 1
very 1
singular 1
points 1
about 1
the 1
moor, 1
dr. 1
watson. 1
oh, 1
excuse 1
me 1
an 1
instant! 1
it 1
is 1
surely 1
cyclopides.” 1
a 1
small 1
fly 1
or 1
moth 1
had 1
fluttered 1
across 1
our 1
path, 1
and 1
in 1
an 1
instant 1
stapleton 1
was 1
rushing 1
with 1
extraordinary 1
energy 1
and 1
speed 1
in 1
pursuit 1
of 1
it. 1
to 1
my 1
dismay 1
the 1
creature 1
flew 1
straight 1
for 1
the 1
great 1
mire, 1
and 1
my 1
acquaintance 1
never 1
paused 1
for 1
an 1
instant, 1
bounding 1
from 1
tuft 1
to 1
tuft 1
behind 1
it, 1
his 1
green 1
net 1
waving 1
in 1
the 1
air. 1
his 1
grey 1
clothes 1
and 1
jerky, 1
zigzag, 1
irregular 1
progress 1
made 1
him 1
not 1
unlike 1
some 1
huge 1
moth 1
himself. 1
i 1
was 1
standing 1
watching 1
his 1
pursuit 1
with 1
a 1
mixture 1
of 1
admiration 1
for 1
his 1
extraordinary 1
activity 1
and 1
fear 1
lest 1
he 1
should 1
lose 1
his 1
footing 1
in 1
the 1
treacherous 1
mire, 1
when 1
i 1
heard 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
steps 1
and, 1
turning 1
round, 1
found 1
a 1
woman 1
near 1
me 1
upon 1
the 1
path. 1
she 1
had 1
come 1
from 1
the 1
direction 1
in 1
which 1
the 1
plume 1
of 1
smoke 1
indicated 1
the 1
position 1
of 1
merripit 1
house, 1
but 1
the 1
dip 1
of 1
the 1
moor 1
had 1
hid 1
her 1
until 1
she 1
was 1
quite 1
close. 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
doubt 1
that 1
this 1
was 1
the 1
miss 1
stapleton 1
of 1
whom 1
i 1
had 1
been 1
told, 1
since 1
ladies 1
of 1
any 1
sort 1
must 1
be 1
few 1
upon 1
the 1
moor, 1
and 1
i 1
remembered 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
heard 1
someone 1
describe 1
her 1
as 1
being 1
a 1
beauty. 1
the 1
woman 1
who 1
approached 1
me 1
was 1
certainly 1
that, 1
and 1
of 1
a 1
most 1
uncommon 1
type. 1
there 1
could 1
not 1
have 1
been 1
a 1
greater 1
contrast 1
between 1
brother 1
and 1
sister, 1
for 1
stapleton 1
was 1
neutral 1
tinted, 1
with 1
light 1
hair 1
and 1
grey 1
eyes, 1
while 1
she 1
was 1
darker 1
than 1
any 1
brunette 1
whom 1
i 1
have 1
seen 1
in 1
england—slim, 1
elegant, 1
and 1
tall. 1
she 1
had 1
a 1
proud, 1
finely 1
cut 1
face, 1
so 1
regular 1
that 1
it 1
might 1
have 1
seemed 1
impassive 1
were 1
it 1
not 1
for 1
the 1
sensitive 1
mouth 1
and 1
the 1
beautiful 1
dark, 1
eager 1
eyes. 1
with 1
her 1
perfect 1
figure 1
and 1
elegant 1
dress 1
she 1
was, 1
indeed, 1
a 1
strange 1
apparition 1
upon 1
a 1
lonely 1
moorland 1
path. 1
her 1
eyes 1
were 1
on 1
her 1
brother 1
as 1
i 1
turned, 1
and 1
then 1
she 1
quickened 1
her 1
pace 1
towards 1
me. 1
i 1
had 1
raised 1
my 1
hat 1
and 1
was 1
about 1
to 1
make 1
some 1
explanatory 1
remark 1
when 1
her 1
own 1
words 1
turned 1
all 1
my 1
thoughts 1
into 1
a 1
new 1
channel. 1
“go 1
back!” 1
she 1
said. 1
“go 1
straight 1
back 1
to 1
london, 1
instantly.” 1
i 1
could 1
only 1
stare 1
at 1
her 1
in 1
stupid 1
surprise. 1
her 1
eyes 1
blazed 1
at 1
me, 1
and 1
she 1
tapped 1
the 1
ground 1
impatiently 1
with 1
her 1
foot. 1
“why 1
should 1
i 1
go 1
back?” 1
i 1
asked. 1
“i 1
cannot 1
explain.” 1
she 1
spoke 1
in 1
a 1
low, 1
eager 1
voice, 1
with 1
a 1
curious 1
lisp 1
in 1
her 1
utterance. 1
“but 1
for 1
god’s 1
sake 1
do 1
what 1
i 1
ask 1
you. 1
go 1
back 1
and 1
never 1
set 1
foot 1
upon 1
the 1
moor 1
again.” 1
“but 1
i 1
have 1
only 1
just 1
come.” 1
“man, 1
man!” 1
she 1
cried. 1
“can 1
you 1
not 1
tell 1
when 1
a 1
warning 1
is 1
for 1
your 1
own 1
good? 1
go 1
back 1
to 1
london! 1
start 1
tonight! 1
get 1
away 1
from 1
this 1
place 1
at 1
all 1
costs! 1
hush, 1
my 1
brother 1
is 1
coming! 1
not 1
a 1
word 1
of 1
what 1
i 1
have 1
said. 1
would 1
you 1
mind 1
getting 1
that 1
orchid 1
for 1
me 1
among 1
the 1
mare’s-tails 1
yonder? 1
we 1
are 1
very 1
rich 1
in 1
orchids 1
on 1
the 1
moor, 1
though, 1
of 1
course, 1
you 1
are 1
rather 1
late 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
beauties 1
of 1
the 1
place.” 1
stapleton 1
had 1
abandoned 1
the 1
chase 1
and 1
came 1
back 1
to 1
us 1
breathing 1
hard 1
and 1
flushed 1
with 1
his 1
exertions. 1
“halloa, 1
beryl!” 1
said 1
he, 1
and 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
the 1
tone 1
of 1
his 1
greeting 1
was 1
not 1
altogether 1
a 1
cordial 1
one. 1
“well, 1
jack, 1
you 1
are 1
very 1
hot.” 1
“yes, 1
i 1
was 1
chasing 1
a 1
cyclopides. 1
he 1
is 1
very 1
rare 1
and 1
seldom 1
found 1
in 1
the 1
late 1
autumn. 1
what 1
a 1
pity 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
have 1
missed 1
him!” 1
he 1
spoke 1
unconcernedly, 1
but 1
his 1
small 1
light 1
eyes 1
glanced 1
incessantly 1
from 1
the 1
girl 1
to 1
me. 1
“you 1
have 1
introduced 1
yourselves, 1
i 1
can 1
see.” 1
“yes. 1
i 1
was 1
telling 1
sir 1
henry 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
rather 1
late 1
for 1
him 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
true 1
beauties 1
of 1
the 1
moor.” 1
“why, 1
who 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
this 1
is?” 1
“i 1
imagine 1
that 1
it 1
must 1
be 1
sir 1
henry 1
baskerville.” 1
“no, 1
no,” 1
said 1
i. 1
“only 1
a 1
humble 1
commoner, 1
but 1
his 1
friend. 1
my 1
name 1
is 1
dr. 1
watson.” 1
a 1
flush 1
of 1
vexation 1
passed 1
over 1
her 1
expressive 1
face. 1
“we 1
have 1
been 1
talking 1
at 1
cross 1
purposes,” 1
said 1
she. 1
“why, 1
you 1
had 1
not 1
very 1
much 1
time 1
for 1
talk,” 1
her 1
brother 1
remarked 1
with 1
the 1
same 1
questioning 1
eyes. 1
“i 1
talked 1
as 1
if 1
dr. 1
watson 1
were 1
a 1
resident 1
instead 1
of 1
being 1
merely 1
a 1
visitor,” 1
said 1
she. 1
“it 1
cannot 1
much 1
matter 1
to 1
him 1
whether 1
it 1
is 1
early 1
or 1
late 1
for 1
the 1
orchids. 1
but 1
you 1
will 1
come 1
on, 1
will 1
you 1
not, 1
and 1
see 1
merripit 1
house?” 1
a 1
short 1
walk 1
brought 1
us 1
to 1
it, 1
a 1
bleak 1
moorland 1
house, 1
once 1
the 1
farm 1
of 1
some 1
grazier 1
in 1
the 1
old 1
prosperous 1
days, 1
but 1
now 1
put 1
into 1
repair 1
and 1
turned 1
into 1
a 1
modern 1
dwelling. 1
an 1
orchard 1
surrounded 1
it, 1
but 1
the 1
trees, 1
as 1
is 1
usual 1
upon 1
the 1
moor, 1
were 1
stunted 1
and 1
nipped, 1
and 1
the 1
effect 1
of 1
the 1
whole 1
place 1
was 1
mean 1
and 1
melancholy. 1
we 1
were 1
admitted 1
by 1
a 1
strange, 1
wizened, 1
rusty-coated 1
old 1
manservant, 1
who 1
seemed 1
in 1
keeping 1
with 1
the 1
house. 1
inside, 1
however, 1
there 1
were 1
large 1
rooms 1
furnished 1
with 1
an 1
elegance 1
in 1
which 1
i 1
seemed 1
to 1
recognize 1
the 1
taste 1
of 1
the 1
lady. 1
as 1
i 1
looked 1
from 1
their 1
windows 1
at 1
the 1
interminable 1
granite-flecked 1
moor 1
rolling 1
unbroken 1
to 1
the 1
farthest 1
horizon 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
but 1
marvel 1
at 1
what 1
could 1
have 1
brought 1
this 1
highly 1
educated 1
man 1
and 1
this 1
beautiful 1
woman 1
to 1
live 1
in 1
such 1
a 1
place. 1
“queer 1
spot 1
to 1
choose, 1
is 1
it 1
not?” 1
said 1
he 1
as 1
if 1
in 1
answer 1
to 1
my 1
thought. 1
“and 1
yet 1
we 1
manage 1
to 1
make 1
ourselves 1
fairly 1
happy, 1
do 1
we 1
not, 1
beryl?” 1
“quite 1
happy,” 1
said 1
she, 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
ring 1
of 1
conviction 1
in 1
her 1
words. 1
“i 1
had 1
a 1
school,” 1
said 1
stapleton. 1
“it 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
north 1
country. 1
the 1
work 1
to 1
a 1
man 1
of 1
my 1
temperament 1
was 1
mechanical 1
and 1
uninteresting, 1
but 1
the 1
privilege 1
of 1
living 1
with 1
youth, 1
of 1
helping 1
to 1
mould 1
those 1
young 1
minds, 1
and 1
of 1
impressing 1
them 1
with 1
one’s 1
own 1
character 1
and 1
ideals 1
was 1
very 1
dear 1
to 1
me. 1
however, 1
the 1
fates 1
were 1
against 1
us. 1
a 1
serious 1
epidemic 1
broke 1
out 1
in 1
the 1
school 1
and 1
three 1
of 1
the 1
boys 1
died. 1
it 1
never 1
recovered 1
from 1
the 1
blow, 1
and 1
much 1
of 1
my 1
capital 1
was 1
irretrievably 1
swallowed 1
up. 1
and 1
yet, 1
if 1
it 1
were 1
not 1
for 1
the 1
loss 1
of 1
the 1
charming 1
companionship 1
of 1
the 1
boys, 1
i 1
could 1
rejoice 1
over 1
my 1
own 1
misfortune, 1
for, 1
with 1
my 1
strong 1
tastes 1
for 1
botany 1
and 1
zoology, 1
i 1
find 1
an 1
unlimited 1
field 1
of 1
work 1
here, 1
and 1
my 1
sister 1
is 1
as 1
devoted 1
to 1
nature 1
as 1
i 1
am. 1
all 1
this, 1
dr. 1
watson, 1
has 1
been 1
brought 1
upon 1
your 1
head 1
by 1
your 1
expression 1
as 1
you 1
surveyed 1
the 1
moor 1
out 1
of 1
our 1
window.” 1
“it 1
certainly 1
did 1
cross 1
my 1
mind 1
that 1
it 1
might 1
be 1
a 1
little 1
dull—less 1
for 1
you, 1
perhaps, 1
than 1
for 1
your 1
sister.” 1
“no, 1
no, 1
i 1
am 1
never 1
dull,” 1
said 1
she 1
quickly. 1
“we 1
have 1
books, 1
we 1
have 1
our 1
studies, 1
and 1
we 1
have 1
interesting 1
neighbours. 1
dr. 1
mortimer 1
is 1
a 1
most 1
learned 1
man 1
in 1
his 1
own 1
line. 1
poor 1
sir 1
charles 1
was 1
also 1
an 1
admirable 1
companion. 1
we 1
knew 1
him 1
well 1
and 1
miss 1
him 1
more 1
than 1
i 1
can 1
tell. 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
intrude 1
if 1
i 1
were 1
to 1
call 1
this 1
afternoon 1
and 1
make 1
the 1
acquaintance 1
of 1
sir 1
henry?” 1
“i 1
am 1
sure 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
be 1
delighted.” 1
“then 1
perhaps 1
you 1
would 1
mention 1
that 1
i 1
propose 1
to 1
do 1
so. 1
we 1
may 1
in 1
our 1
humble 1
way 1
do 1
something 1
to 1
make 1
things 1
more 1
easy 1
for 1
him 1
until 1
he 1
becomes 1
accustomed 1
to 1
his 1
new 1
surroundings. 1
will 1
you 1
come 1
upstairs, 1
dr. 1
watson, 1
and 1
inspect 1
my 1
collection 1
of 1
lepidoptera? 1
i 1
think 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
most 1
complete 1
one 1
in 1
the 1
south-west 1
of 1
england. 1
by 1
the 1
time 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
looked 1
through 1
them 1
lunch 1
will 1
be 1
almost 1
ready.” 1
but 1
i 1
was 1
eager 1
to 1
get 1
back 1
to 1
my 1
charge. 1
the 1
melancholy 1
of 1
the 1
moor, 1
the 1
death 1
of 1
the 1
unfortunate 1
pony, 1
the 1
weird 1
sound 1
which 1
had 1
been 1
associated 1
with 1
the 1
grim 1
legend 1
of 1
the 1
baskervilles, 1
all 1
these 1
things 1
tinged 1
my 1
thoughts 1
with 1
sadness. 1
then 1
on 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
these 1
more 1
or 1
less 1
vague 1
impressions 1
there 1
had 1
come 1
the 1
definite 1
and 1
distinct 1
warning 1
of 1
miss 1
stapleton, 1
delivered 1
with 1
such 1
intense 1
earnestness 1
that 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
doubt 1
that 1
some 1
grave 1
and 1
deep 1
reason 1
lay 1
behind 1
it. 1
i 1
resisted 1
all 1
pressure 1
to 1
stay 1
for 1
lunch, 1
and 1
i 1
set 1
off 1
at 1
once 1
upon 1
my 1
return 1
journey, 1
taking 1
the 1
grass-grown 1
path 1
by 1
which 1
we 1
had 1
come. 1
it 1
seems, 1
however, 1
that 1
there 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
some 1
short 1
cut 1
for 1
those 1
who 1
knew 1
it, 1
for 1
before 1
i 1
had 1
reached 1
the 1
road 1
i 1
was 1
astounded 1
to 1
see 1
miss 1
stapleton 1
sitting 1
upon 1
a 1
rock 1
by 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
track. 1
her 1
face 1
was 1
beautifully 1
flushed 1
with 1
her 1
exertions 1
and 1
she 1
held 1
her 1
hand 1
to 1
her 1
side. 1
“i 1
have 1
run 1
all 1
the 1
way 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
cut 1
you 1
off, 1
dr. 1
watson,” 1
said 1
she. 1
“i 1
had 1
not 1
even 1
time 1
to 1
put 1
on 1
my 1
hat. 1
i 1
must 1
not 1
stop, 1
or 1
my 1
brother 1
may 1
miss 1
me. 1
i 1
wanted 1
to 1
say 1
to 1
you 1
how 1
sorry 1
i 1
am 1
about 1
the 1
stupid 1
mistake 1
i 1
made 1
in 1
thinking 1
that 1
you 1
were 1
sir 1
henry. 1
please 1
forget 1
the 1
words 1
i 1
said, 1
which 1
have 1
no 1
application 1
whatever 1
to 1
you.” 1
“but 1
i 1
can’t 1
forget 1
them, 1
miss 1
stapleton,” 1
said 1
i. 1
“i 1
am 1
sir 1
henry’s 1
friend, 1
and 1
his 1
welfare 1
is 1
a 1
very 1
close 1
concern 1
of 1
mine. 1
tell 1
me 1
why 1
it 1
was 1
that 1
you 1
were 1
so 1
eager 1
that 1
sir 1
henry 1
should 1
return 1
to 1
london.” 1
“a 1
woman’s 1
whim, 1
dr. 1
watson. 1
when 1
you 1
know 1
me 1
better 1
you 1
will 1
understand 1
that 1
i 1
cannot 1
always 1
give 1
reasons 1
for 1
what 1
i 1
say 1
or 1
do.” 1
“no, 1
no. 1
i 1
remember 1
the 1
thrill 1
in 1
your 1
voice. 1
i 1
remember 1
the 1
look 1
in 1
your 1
eyes. 1
please, 1
please, 1
be 1
frank 1
with 1
me, 1
miss 1
stapleton, 1
for 1
ever 1
since 1
i 1
have 1
been 1
here 1
i 1
have 1
been 1
conscious 1
of 1
shadows 1
all 1
round 1
me. 1
life 1
has 1
become 1
like 1
that 1
great 1
grimpen 1
mire, 1
with 1
little 1
green 1
patches 1
everywhere 1
into 1
which 1
one 1
may 1
sink 1
and 1
with 1
no 1
guide 1
to 1
point 1
the 1
track. 1
tell 1
me 1
then 1
what 1
it 1
was 1
that 1
you 1
meant, 1
and 1
i 1
will 1
promise 1
to 1
convey 1
your 1
warning 1
to 1
sir 1
henry.” 1
an 1
expression 1
of 1
irresolution 1
passed 1
for 1
an 1
instant 1
over 1
her 1
face, 1
but 1
her 1
eyes 1
had 1
hardened 1
again 1
when 1
she 1
answered 1
me. 1
“you 1
make 1
too 1
much 1
of 1
it, 1
dr. 1
watson,” 1
said 1
she. 1
“my 1
brother 1
and 1
i 1
were 1
very 1
much 1
shocked 1
by 1
the 1
death 1
of 1
sir 1
charles. 1
we 1
knew 1
him 1
very 1
intimately, 1
for 1
his 1
favourite 1
walk 1
was 1
over 1
the 1
moor 1
to 1
our 1
house. 1
he 1
was 1
deeply 1
impressed 1
with 1
the 1
curse 1
which 1
hung 1
over 1
the 1
family, 1
and 1
when 1
this 1
tragedy 1
came 1
i 1
naturally 1
felt 1
that 1
there 1
must 1
be 1
some 1
grounds 1
for 1
the 1
fears 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
expressed. 1
i 1
was 1
distressed 1
therefore 1
when 1
another 1
member 1
of 1
the 1
family 1
came 1
down 1
to 1
live 1
here, 1
and 1
i 1
felt 1
that 1
he 1
should 1
be 1
warned 1
of 1
the 1
danger 1
which 1
he 1
will 1
run. 1
that 1
was 1
all 1
which 1
i 1
intended 1
to 1
convey. 1
“but 1
what 1
is 1
the 1
danger?” 1
“you 1
know 1
the 1
story 1
of 1
the 1
hound?” 1
“i 1
do 1
not 1
believe 1
in 1
such 1
nonsense.” 1
“but 1
i 1
do. 1
if 1
you 1
have 1
any 1
influence 1
with 1
sir 1
henry, 1
take 1
him 1
away 1
from 1
a 1
place 1
which 1
has 1
always 1
been 1
fatal 1
to 1
his 1
family. 1
the 1
world 1
is 1
wide. 1
why 1
should 1
he 1
wish 1
to 1
live 1
at 1
the 1
place 1
of 1
danger?” 1
“because 1
it 1
_is_ 1
the 1
place 1
of 1
danger. 1
that 1
is 1
sir 1
henry’s 1
nature. 1
i 1
fear 1
that 1
unless 1
you 1
can 1
give 1
me 1
some 1
more 1
definite 1
information 1
than 1
this 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
impossible 1
to 1
get 1
him 1
to 1
move.” 1
“i 1
cannot 1
say 1
anything 1
definite, 1
for 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
anything 1
definite.” 1
“i 1
would 1
ask 1
you 1
one 1
more 1
question, 1
miss 1
stapleton. 1
if 1
you 1
meant 1
no 1
more 1
than 1
this 1
when 1
you 1
first 1
spoke 1
to 1
me, 1
why 1
should 1
you 1
not 1
wish 1
your 1
brother 1
to 1
overhear 1
what 1
you 1
said? 1
there 1
is 1
nothing 1
to 1
which 1
he, 1
or 1
anyone 1
else, 1
could 1
object.” 1
“my 1
brother 1
is 1
very 1
anxious 1
to 1
have 1
the 1
hall 1
inhabited, 1
for 1
he 1
thinks 1
it 1
is 1
for 1
the 1
good 1
of 1
the 1
poor 1
folk 1
upon 1
the 1
moor. 1
he 1
would 1
be 1
very 1
angry 1
if 1
he 1
knew 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
said 1
anything 1
which 1
might 1
induce 1
sir 1
henry 1
to 1
go 1
away. 1
but 1
i 1
have 1
done 1
my 1
duty 1
now 1
and 1
i 1
will 1
say 1
no 1
more. 1
i 1
must 1
go 1
back, 1
or 1
he 1
will 1
miss 1
me 1
and 1
suspect 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
seen 1
you. 1
good-bye!” 1
she 1
turned 1
and 1
had 1
disappeared 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
among 1
the 1
scattered 1
boulders, 1
while 1
i, 1
with 1
my 1
soul 1
full 1
of 1
vague 1
fears, 1
pursued 1
my 1
way 1
to 1
baskerville 1
hall. 1
chapter 1
8. 1
first 1
report 1
of 1
dr. 1
watson 1
from 1
this 1
point 1
onward 1
i 1
will 1
follow 1
the 1
course 1
of 1
events 1
by 1
transcribing 1
my 1
own 1
letters 1
to 1
mr. 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
which 1
lie 1
before 1
me 1
on 1
the 1
table. 1
one 1
page 1
is 1
missing, 1
but 1
otherwise 1
they 1
are 1
exactly 1
as 1
written 1
and 1
show 1
my 1
feelings 1
and 1
suspicions 1
of 1
the 1
moment 1
more 1
accurately 1
than 1
my 1
memory, 1
clear 1
as 1
it 1
is 1
upon 1
these 1
tragic 1
events, 1
can 1
possibly 1
do. 1
baskerville 1
hall, 1
october 1
13th. 1
my 1
dear 1
holmes, 1
my 1
previous 1
letters 1
and 1
telegrams 1
have 1
kept 1
you 1
pretty 1
well 1
up 1
to 1
date 1
as 1
to 1
all 1
that 1
has 1
occurred 1
in 1
this 1
most 1
god-forsaken 1
corner 1
of 1
the 1
world. 1
the 1
longer 1
one 1
stays 1
here 1
the 1
more 1
does 1
the 1
spirit 1
of 1
the 1
moor 1
sink 1
into 1
one’s 1
soul, 1
its 1
vastness, 1
and 1
also 1
its 1
grim 1
charm. 1
when 1
you 1
are 1
once 1
out 1
upon 1
its 1
bosom 1
you 1
have 1
left 1
all 1
traces 1
of 1
modern 1
england 1
behind 1
you, 1
but, 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
hand, 1
you 1
are 1
conscious 1
everywhere 1
of 1
the 1
homes 1
and 1
the 1
work 1
of 1
the 1
prehistoric 1
people. 1
on 1
all 1
sides 1
of 1
you 1
as 1
you 1
walk 1
are 1
the 1
houses 1
of 1
these 1
forgotten 1
folk, 1
with 1
their 1
graves 1
and 1
the 1
huge 1
monoliths 1
which 1
are 1
supposed 1
to 1
have 1
marked 1
their 1
temples. 1
as 1
you 1
look 1
at 1
their 1
grey 1
stone 1
huts 1
against 1
the 1
scarred 1
hillsides 1
you 1
leave 1
your 1
own 1
age 1
behind 1
you, 1
and 1
if 1
you 1
were 1
to 1
see 1
a 1
skin-clad, 1
hairy 1
man 1
crawl 1
out 1
from 1
the 1
low 1
door 1
fitting 1
a 1
flint-tipped 1
arrow 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
string 1
of 1
his 1
bow, 1
you 1
would 1
feel 1
that 1
his 1
presence 1
there 1
was 1
more 1
natural 1
than 1
your 1
own. 1
the 1
strange 1
thing 1
is 1
that 1
they 1
should 1
have 1
lived 1
so 1
thickly 1
on 1
what 1
must 1
always 1
have 1
been 1
most 1
unfruitful 1
soil. 1
i 1
am 1
no 1
antiquarian, 1
but 1
i 1
could 1
imagine 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
some 1
unwarlike 1
and 1
harried 1
race 1
who 1
were 1
forced 1
to 1
accept 1
that 1
which 1
none 1
other 1
would 1
occupy. 1
all 1
this, 1
however, 1
is 1
foreign 1
to 1
the 1
mission 1
on 1
which 1
you 1
sent 1
me 1
and 1
will 1
probably 1
be 1
very 1
uninteresting 1
to 1
your 1
severely 1
practical 1
mind. 1
i 1
can 1
still 1
remember 1
your 1
complete 1
indifference 1
as 1
to 1
whether 1
the 1
sun 1
moved 1
round 1
the 1
earth 1
or 1
the 1
earth 1
round 1
the 1
sun. 1
let 1
me, 1
therefore, 1
return 1
to 1
the 1
facts 1
concerning 1
sir 1
henry 1
baskerville. 1
if 1
you 1
have 1
not 1
had 1
any 1
report 1
within 1
the 1
last 1
few 1
days 1
it 1
is 1
because 1
up 1
to 1
today 1
there 1
was 1
nothing 1
of 1
importance 1
to 1
relate. 1
then 1
a 1
very 1
surprising 1
circumstance 1
occurred, 1
which 1
i 1
shall 1
tell 1
you 1
in 1
due 1
course. 1
but, 1
first 1
of 1
all, 1
i 1
must 1
keep 1
you 1
in 1
touch 1
with 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
other 1
factors 1
in 1
the 1
situation. 1
one 1
of 1
these, 1
concerning 1
which 1
i 1
have 1
said 1
little, 1
is 1
the 1
escaped 1
convict 1
upon 1
the 1
moor. 1
there 1
is 1
strong 1
reason 1
now 1
to 1
believe 1
that 1
he 1
has 1
got 1
right 1
away, 1
which 1
is 1
a 1
considerable 1
relief 1
to 1
the 1
lonely 1
householders 1
of 1
this 1
district. 1
a 1
fortnight 1
has 1
passed 1
since 1
his 1
flight, 1
during 1
which 1
he 1
has 1
not 1
been 1
seen 1
and 1
nothing 1
has 1
been 1
heard 1
of 1
him. 1
it 1
is 1
surely 1
inconceivable 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
have 1
held 1
out 1
upon 1
the 1
moor 1
during 1
all 1
that 1
time. 1
of 1
course, 1
so 1
far 1
as 1
his 1
concealment 1
goes 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
difficulty 1
at 1
all. 1
any 1
one 1
of 1
these 1
stone 1
huts 1
would 1
give 1
him 1
a 1
hiding-place. 1
but 1
there 1
is 1
nothing 1
to 1
eat 1
unless 1
he 1
were 1
to 1
catch 1
and 1
slaughter 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
moor 1
sheep. 1
we 1
think, 1
therefore, 1
that 1
he 1
has 1
gone, 1
and 1
the 1
outlying 1
farmers 1
sleep 1
the 1
better 1
in 1
consequence. 1
we 1
are 1
four 1
able-bodied 1
men 1
in 1
this 1
household, 1
so 1
that 1
we 1
could 1
take 1
good 1
care 1
of 1
ourselves, 1
but 1
i 1
confess 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
had 1
uneasy 1
moments 1
when 1
i 1
have 1
thought 1
of 1
the 1
stapletons. 1
they 1
live 1
miles 1
from 1
any 1
help. 1
there 1
are 1
one 1
maid, 1
an 1
old 1
manservant, 1
the 1
sister, 1
and 1
the 1
brother, 1
the 1
latter 1
not 1
a 1
very 1
strong 1
man. 1
they 1
would 1
be 1
helpless 1
in 1
the 1
hands 1
of 1
a 1
desperate 1
fellow 1
like 1
this 1
notting 1
hill 1
criminal 1
if 1
he 1
could 1
once 1
effect 1
an 1
entrance. 1
both 1
sir 1
henry 1
and 1
i 1
were 1
concerned 1
at 1
their 1
situation, 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
suggested 1
that 1
perkins 1
the 1
groom 1
should 1
go 1
over 1
to 1
sleep 1
there, 1
but 1
stapleton 1
would 1
not 1
hear 1
of 1
it. 1
the 1
fact 1
is 1
that 1
our 1
friend, 1
the 1
baronet, 1
begins 1
to 1
display 1
a 1
considerable 1
interest 1
in 1
our 1
fair 1
neighbour. 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
to 1
be 1
wondered 1
at, 1
for 1
time 1
hangs 1
heavily 1
in 1
this 1
lonely 1
spot 1
to 1
an 1
active 1
man 1
like 1
him, 1
and 1
she 1
is 1
a 1
very 1
fascinating 1
and 1
beautiful 1
woman. 1
there 1
is 1
something 1
tropical 1
and 1
exotic 1
about 1
her 1
which 1
forms 1
a 1
singular 1
contrast 1
to 1
her 1
cool 1
and 1
unemotional 1
brother. 1
yet 1
he 1
also 1
gives 1
the 1
idea 1
of 1
hidden 1
fires. 1
he 1
has 1
certainly 1
a 1
very 1
marked 1
influence 1
over 1
her, 1
for 1
i 1
have 1
seen 1
her 1
continually 1
glance 1
at 1
him 1
as 1
she 1
talked 1
as 1
if 1
seeking 1
approbation 1
for 1
what 1
she 1
said. 1
i 1
trust 1
that 1
he 1
is 1
kind 1
to 1
her. 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
dry 1
glitter 1
in 1
his 1
eyes 1
and 1
a 1
firm 1
set 1
of 1
his 1
thin 1
lips, 1
which 1
goes 1
with 1
a 1
positive 1
and 1
possibly 1
a 1
harsh 1
nature. 1
you 1
would 1
find 1
him 1
an 1
interesting 1
study. 1
he 1
came 1
over 1
to 1
call 1
upon 1
baskerville 1
on 1
that 1
first 1
day, 1
and 1
the 1
very 1
next 1
morning 1
he 1
took 1
us 1
both 1
to 1
show 1
us 1
the 1
spot 1
where 1
the 1
legend 1
of 1
the 1
wicked 1
hugo 1
is 1
supposed 1
to 1
have 1
had 1
its 1
origin. 1
it 1
was 1
an 1
excursion 1
of 1
some 1
miles 1
across 1
the 1
moor 1
to 1
a 1
place 1
which 1
is 1
so 1
dismal 1
that 1
it 1
might 1
have 1
suggested 1
the 1
story. 1
we 1
found 1
a 1
short 1
valley 1
between 1
rugged 1
tors 1
which 1
led 1
to 1
an 1
open, 1
grassy 1
space 1
flecked 1
over 1
with 1
the 1
white 1
cotton 1
grass. 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
it 1
rose 1
two 1
great 1
stones, 1
worn 1
and 1
sharpened 1
at 1
the 1
upper 1
end 1
until 1
they 1
looked 1
like 1
the 1
huge 1
corroding 1
fangs 1
of 1
some 1
monstrous 1
beast. 1
in 1
every 1
way 1
it 1
corresponded 1
with 1
the 1
scene 1
of 1
the 1
old 1
tragedy. 1
sir 1
henry 1
was 1
much 1
interested 1
and 1
asked 1
stapleton 1
more 1
than 1
once 1
whether 1
he 1
did 1
really 1
believe 1
in 1
the 1
possibility 1
of 1
the 1
interference 1
of 1
the 1
supernatural 1
in 1
the 1
affairs 1
of 1
men. 1
he 1
spoke 1
lightly, 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
evident 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
very 1
much 1
in 1
earnest. 1
stapleton 1
was 1
guarded 1
in 1
his 1
replies, 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
easy 1
to 1
see 1
that 1
he 1
said 1
less 1
than 1
he 1
might, 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
not 1
express 1
his 1
whole 1
opinion 1
out 1
of 1
consideration 1
for 1
the 1
feelings 1
of 1
the 1
baronet. 1
he 1
told 1
us 1
of 1
similar 1
cases, 1
where 1
families 1
had 1
suffered 1
from 1
some 1
evil 1
influence, 1
and 1
he 1
left 1
us 1
with 1
the 1
impression 1
that 1
he 1
shared 1
the 1
popular 1
view 1
upon 1
the 1
matter. 1
on 1
our 1
way 1
back 1
we 1
stayed 1
for 1
lunch 1
at 1
merripit 1
house, 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
there 1
that 1
sir 1
henry 1
made 1
the 1
acquaintance 1
of 1
miss 1
stapleton. 1
from 1
the 1
first 1
moment 1
that 1
he 1
saw 1
her 1
he 1
appeared 1
to 1
be 1
strongly 1
attracted 1
by 1
her, 1
and 1
i 1
am 1
much 1
mistaken 1
if 1
the 1
feeling 1
was 1
not 1
mutual. 1
he 1
referred 1
to 1
her 1
again 1
and 1
again 1
on 1
our 1
walk 1
home, 1
and 1
since 1
then 1
hardly 1
a 1
day 1
has 1
passed 1
that 1
we 1
have 1
not 1
seen 1
something 1
of 1
the 1
brother 1
and 1
sister. 1
they 1
dine 1
here 1
tonight, 1
and 1
there 1
is 1
some 1
talk 1
of 1
our 1
going 1
to 1
them 1
next 1
week. 1
one 1
would 1
imagine 1
that 1
such 1
a 1
match 1
would 1
be 1
very 1
welcome 1
to 1
stapleton, 1
and 1
yet 1
i 1
have 1
more 1
than 1
once 1
caught 1
a 1
look 1
of 1
the 1
strongest 1
disapprobation 1
in 1
his 1
face 1
when 1
sir 1
henry 1
has 1
been 1
paying 1
some 1
attention 1
to 1
his 1
sister. 1
he 1
is 1
much 1
attached 1
to 1
her, 1
no 1
doubt, 1
and 1
would 1
lead 1
a 1
lonely 1
life 1
without 1
her, 1
but 1
it 1
would 1
seem 1
the 1
height 1
of 1
selfishness 1
if 1
he 1
were 1
to 1
stand 1
in 1
the 1
way 1
of 1
her 1
making 1
so 1
brilliant 1
a 1
marriage. 1
yet 1
i 1
am 1
certain 1
that 1
he 1
does 1
not 1
wish 1
their 1
intimacy 1
to 1
ripen 1
into 1
love, 1
and 1
i 1
have 1
several 1
times 1
observed 1
that 1
he 1
has 1
taken 1
pains 1
to 1
prevent 1
them 1
from 1
being 1
_tête-à-tête_. 1
by 1
the 1
way, 1
your 1
instructions 1
to 1
me 1
never 1
to 1
allow 1
sir 1
henry 1
to 1
go 1
out 1
alone 1
will 1
become 1
very 1
much 1
more 1
onerous 1
if 1
a 1
love 1
affair 1
were 1
to 1
be 1
added 1
to 1
our 1
other 1
difficulties. 1
my 1
popularity 1
would 1
soon 1
suffer 1
if 1
i 1
were 1
to 1
carry 1
out 1
your 1
orders 1
to 1
the 1
letter. 1
the 1
other 1
day—thursday, 1
to 1
be 1
more 1
exact—dr. 1
mortimer 1
lunched 1
with 1
us. 1
he 1
has 1
been 1
excavating 1
a 1
barrow 1
at 1
long 1
down 1
and 1
has 1
got 1
a 1
prehistoric 1
skull 1
which 1
fills 1
him 1
with 1
great 1
joy. 1
never 1
was 1
there 1
such 1
a 1
single-minded 1
enthusiast 1
as 1
he! 1
the 1
stapletons 1
came 1
in 1
afterwards, 1
and 1
the 1
good 1
doctor 1
took 1
us 1
all 1
to 1
the 1
yew 1
alley 1
at 1
sir 1
henry’s 1
request 1
to 1
show 1
us 1
exactly 1
how 1
everything 1
occurred 1
upon 1
that 1
fatal 1
night. 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
long, 1
dismal 1
walk, 1
the 1
yew 1
alley, 1
between 1
two 1
high 1
walls 1
of 1
clipped 1
hedge, 1
with 1
a 1
narrow 1
band 1
of 1
grass 1
upon 1
either 1
side. 1
at 1
the 1
far 1
end 1
is 1
an 1
old 1
tumble-down 1
summer-house. 1
halfway 1
down 1
is 1
the 1
moor-gate, 1
where 1
the 1
old 1
gentleman 1
left 1
his 1
cigar-ash. 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
white 1
wooden 1
gate 1
with 1
a 1
latch. 1
beyond 1
it 1
lies 1
the 1
wide 1
moor. 1
i 1
remembered 1
your 1
theory 1
of 1
the 1
affair 1
and 1
tried 1
to 1
picture 1
all 1
that 1
had 1
occurred. 1
as 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
stood 1
there 1
he 1
saw 1
something 1
coming 1
across 1
the 1
moor, 1
something 1
which 1
terrified 1
him 1
so 1
that 1
he 1
lost 1
his 1
wits 1
and 1
ran 1
and 1
ran 1
until 1
he 1
died 1
of 1
sheer 1
horror 1
and 1
exhaustion. 1
there 1
was 1
the 1
long, 1
gloomy 1
tunnel 1
down 1
which 1
he 1
fled. 1
and 1
from 1
what? 1
a 1
sheep-dog 1
of 1
the 1
moor? 1
or 1
a 1
spectral 1
hound, 1
black, 1
silent, 1
and 1
monstrous? 1
was 1
there 1
a 1
human 1
agency 1
in 1
the 1
matter? 1
did 1
the 1
pale, 1
watchful 1
barrymore 1
know 1
more 1
than 1
he 1
cared 1
to 1
say? 1
it 1
was 1
all 1
dim 1
and 1
vague, 1
but 1
always 1
there 1
is 1
the 1
dark 1
shadow 1
of 1
crime 1
behind 1
it. 1
one 1
other 1
neighbour 1
i 1
have 1
met 1
since 1
i 1
wrote 1
last. 1
this 1
is 1
mr. 1
frankland, 1
of 1
lafter 1
hall, 1
who 1
lives 1
some 1
four 1
miles 1
to 1
the 1
south 1
of 1
us. 1
he 1
is 1
an 1
elderly 1
man, 1
red-faced, 1
white-haired, 1
and 1
choleric. 1
his 1
passion 1
is 1
for 1
the 1
british 1
law, 1
and 1
he 1
has 1
spent 1
a 1
large 1
fortune 1
in 1
litigation. 1
he 1
fights 1
for 1
the 1
mere 1
pleasure 1
of 1
fighting 1
and 1
is 1
equally 1
ready 1
to 1
take 1
up 1
either 1
side 1
of 1
a 1
question, 1
so 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
no 1
wonder 1
that 1
he 1
has 1
found 1
it 1
a 1
costly 1
amusement. 1
sometimes 1
he 1
will 1
shut 1
up 1
a 1
right 1
of 1
way 1
and 1
defy 1
the 1
parish 1
to 1
make 1
him 1
open 1
it. 1
at 1
others 1
he 1
will 1
with 1
his 1
own 1
hands 1
tear 1
down 1
some 1
other 1
man’s 1
gate 1
and 1
declare 1
that 1
a 1
path 1
has 1
existed 1
there 1
from 1
time 1
immemorial, 1
defying 1
the 1
owner 1
to 1
prosecute 1
him 1
for 1
trespass. 1
he 1
is 1
learned 1
in 1
old 1
manorial 1
and 1
communal 1
rights, 1
and 1
he 1
applies 1
his 1
knowledge 1
sometimes 1
in 1
favour 1
of 1
the 1
villagers 1
of 1
fernworthy 1
and 1
sometimes 1
against 1
them, 1
so 1
that 1
he 1
is 1
periodically 1
either 1
carried 1
in 1
triumph 1
down 1
the 1
village 1
street 1
or 1
else 1
burned 1
in 1
effigy, 1
according 1
to 1
his 1
latest 1
exploit. 1
he 1
is 1
said 1
to 1
have 1
about 1
seven 1
lawsuits 1
upon 1
his 1
hands 1
at 1
present, 1
which 1
will 1
probably 1
swallow 1
up 1
the 1
remainder 1
of 1
his 1
fortune 1
and 1
so 1
draw 1
his 1
sting 1
and 1
leave 1
him 1
harmless 1
for 1
the 1
future. 1
apart 1
from 1
the 1
law 1
he 1
seems 1
a 1
kindly, 1
good-natured 1
person, 1
and 1
i 1
only 1
mention 1
him 1
because 1
you 1
were 1
particular 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
send 1
some 1
description 1
of 1
the 1
people 1
who 1
surround 1
us. 1
he 1
is 1
curiously 1
employed 1
at 1
present, 1
for, 1
being 1
an 1
amateur 1
astronomer, 1
he 1
has 1
an 1
excellent 1
telescope, 1
with 1
which 1
he 1
lies 1
upon 1
the 1
roof 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
house 1
and 1
sweeps 1
the 1
moor 1
all 1
day 1
in 1
the 1
hope 1
of 1
catching 1
a 1
glimpse 1
of 1
the 1
escaped 1
convict. 1
if 1
he 1
would 1
confine 1
his 1
energies 1
to 1
this 1
all 1
would 1
be 1
well, 1
but 1
there 1
are 1
rumours 1
that 1
he 1
intends 1
to 1
prosecute 1
dr. 1
mortimer 1
for 1
opening 1
a 1
grave 1
without 1
the 1
consent 1
of 1
the 1
next 1
of 1
kin 1
because 1
he 1
dug 1
up 1
the 1
neolithic 1
skull 1
in 1
the 1
barrow 1
on 1
long 1
down. 1
he 1
helps 1
to 1
keep 1
our 1
lives 1
from 1
being 1
monotonous 1
and 1
gives 1
a 1
little 1
comic 1
relief 1
where 1
it 1
is 1
badly 1
needed. 1
and 1
now, 1
having 1
brought 1
you 1
up 1
to 1
date 1
in 1
the 1
escaped 1
convict, 1
the 1
stapletons, 1
dr. 1
mortimer, 1
and 1
frankland, 1
of 1
lafter 1
hall, 1
let 1
me 1
end 1
on 1
that 1
which 1
is 1
most 1
important 1
and 1
tell 1
you 1
more 1
about 1
the 1
barrymores, 1
and 1
especially 1
about 1
the 1
surprising 1
development 1
of 1
last 1
night. 1
first 1
of 1
all 1
about 1
the 1
test 1
telegram, 1
which 1
you 1
sent 1
from 1
london 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
make 1
sure 1
that 1
barrymore 1
was 1
really 1
here. 1
i 1
have 1
already 1
explained 1
that 1
the 1
testimony 1
of 1
the 1
postmaster 1
shows 1
that 1
the 1
test 1
was 1
worthless 1
and 1
that 1
we 1
have 1
no 1
proof 1
one 1
way 1
or 1
the 1
other. 1
i 1
told 1
sir 1
henry 1
how 1
the 1
matter 1
stood, 1
and 1
he 1
at 1
once, 1
in 1
his 1
downright 1
fashion, 1
had 1
barrymore 1
up 1
and 1
asked 1
him 1
whether 1
he 1
had 1
received 1
the 1
telegram 1
himself. 1
barrymore 1
said 1
that 1
he 1
had. 1
“did 1
the 1
boy 1
deliver 1
it 1
into 1
your 1
own 1
hands?” 1
asked 1
sir 1
henry. 1
barrymore 1
looked 1
surprised, 1
and 1
considered 1
for 1
a 1
little 1
time. 1
“no,” 1
said 1
he, 1
“i 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
box-room 1
at 1
the 1
time, 1
and 1
my 1
wife 1
brought 1
it 1
up 1
to 1
me.” 1
“did 1
you 1
answer 1
it 1
yourself?” 1
“no; 1
i 1
told 1
my 1
wife 1
what 1
to 1
answer 1
and 1
she 1
went 1
down 1
to 1
write 1
it.” 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
he 1
recurred 1
to 1
the 1
subject 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
accord. 1
“i 1
could 1
not 1
quite 1
understand 1
the 1
object 1
of 1
your 1
questions 1
this 1
morning, 1
sir 1
henry,” 1
said 1
he. 1
“i 1
trust 1
that 1
they 1
do 1
not 1
mean 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
done 1
anything 1
to 1
forfeit 1
your 1
confidence?” 1
sir 1
henry 1
had 1
to 1
assure 1
him 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
so 1
and 1
pacify 1
him 1
by 1
giving 1
him 1
a 1
considerable 1
part 1
of 1
his 1
old 1
wardrobe, 1
the 1
london 1
outfit 1
having 1
now 1
all 1
arrived. 1
mrs. 1
barrymore 1
is 1
of 1
interest 1
to 1
me. 1
she 1
is 1
a 1
heavy, 1
solid 1
person, 1
very 1
limited, 1
intensely 1
respectable, 1
and 1
inclined 1
to 1
be 1
puritanical. 1
you 1
could 1
hardly 1
conceive 1
a 1
less 1
emotional 1
subject. 1
yet 1
i 1
have 1
told 1
you 1
how, 1
on 1
the 1
first 1
night 1
here, 1
i 1
heard 1
her 1
sobbing 1
bitterly, 1
and 1
since 1
then 1
i 1
have 1
more 1
than 1
once 1
observed 1
traces 1
of 1
tears 1
upon 1
her 1
face. 1
some 1
deep 1
sorrow 1
gnaws 1
ever 1
at 1
her 1
heart. 1
sometimes 1
i 1
wonder 1
if 1
she 1
has 1
a 1
guilty 1
memory 1
which 1
haunts 1
her, 1
and 1
sometimes 1
i 1
suspect 1
barrymore 1
of 1
being 1
a 1
domestic 1
tyrant. 1
i 1
have 1
always 1
felt 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
something 1
singular 1
and 1
questionable 1
in 1
this 1
man’s 1
character, 1
but 1
the 1
adventure 1
of 1
last 1
night 1
brings 1
all 1
my 1
suspicions 1
to 1
a 1
head. 1
and 1
yet 1
it 1
may 1
seem 1
a 1
small 1
matter 1
in 1
itself. 1
you 1
are 1
aware 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
not 1
a 1
very 1
sound 1
sleeper, 1
and 1
since 1
i 1
have 1
been 1
on 1
guard 1
in 1
this 1
house 1
my 1
slumbers 1
have 1
been 1
lighter 1
than 1
ever. 1
last 1
night, 1
about 1
two 1
in 1
the 1
morning, 1
i 1
was 1
aroused 1
by 1
a 1
stealthy 1
step 1
passing 1
my 1
room. 1
i 1
rose, 1
opened 1
my 1
door, 1
and 1
peeped 1
out. 1
a 1
long 1
black 1
shadow 1
was 1
trailing 1
down 1
the 1
corridor. 1
it 1
was 1
thrown 1
by 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
walked 1
softly 1
down 1
the 1
passage 1
with 1
a 1
candle 1
held 1
in 1
his 1
hand. 1
he 1
was 1
in 1
shirt 1
and 1
trousers, 1
with 1
no 1
covering 1
to 1
his 1
feet. 1
i 1
could 1
merely 1
see 1
the 1
outline, 1
but 1
his 1
height 1
told 1
me 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
barrymore. 1
he 1
walked 1
very 1
slowly 1
and 1
circumspectly, 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
something 1
indescribably 1
guilty 1
and 1
furtive 1
in 1
his 1
whole 1
appearance. 1
i 1
have 1
told 1
you 1
that 1
the 1
corridor 1
is 1
broken 1
by 1
the 1
balcony 1
which 1
runs 1
round 1
the 1
hall, 1
but 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
resumed 1
upon 1
the 1
farther 1
side. 1
i 1
waited 1
until 1
he 1
had 1
passed 1
out 1
of 1
sight 1
and 1
then 1
i 1
followed 1
him. 1
when 1
i 1
came 1
round 1
the 1
balcony 1
he 1
had 1
reached 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
farther 1
corridor, 1
and 1
i 1
could 1
see 1
from 1
the 1
glimmer 1
of 1
light 1
through 1
an 1
open 1
door 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
entered 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
rooms. 1
now, 1
all 1
these 1
rooms 1
are 1
unfurnished 1
and 1
unoccupied 1
so 1
that 1
his 1
expedition 1
became 1
more 1
mysterious 1
than 1
ever. 1
the 1
light 1
shone 1
steadily 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
were 1
standing 1
motionless. 1
i 1
crept 1
down 1
the 1
passage 1
as 1
noiselessly 1
as 1
i 1
could 1
and 1
peeped 1
round 1
the 1
corner 1
of 1
the 1
door. 1
barrymore 1
was 1
crouching 1
at 1
the 1
window 1
with 1
the 1
candle 1
held 1
against 1
the 1
glass. 1
his 1
profile 1
was 1
half 1
turned 1
towards 1
me, 1
and 1
his 1
face 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
rigid 1
with 1
expectation 1
as 1
he 1
stared 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
blackness 1
of 1
the 1
moor. 1
for 1
some 1
minutes 1
he 1
stood 1
watching 1
intently. 1
then 1
he 1
gave 1
a 1
deep 1
groan 1
and 1
with 1
an 1
impatient 1
gesture 1
he 1
put 1
out 1
the 1
light. 1
instantly 1
i 1
made 1
my 1
way 1
back 1
to 1
my 1
room, 1
and 1
very 1
shortly 1
came 1
the 1
stealthy 1
steps 1
passing 1
once 1
more 1
upon 1
their 1
return 1
journey. 1
long 1
afterwards 1
when 1
i 1
had 1
fallen 1
into 1
a 1
light 1
sleep 1
i 1
heard 1
a 1
key 1
turn 1
somewhere 1
in 1
a 1
lock, 1
but 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
tell 1
whence 1
the 1
sound 1
came. 1
what 1
it 1
all 1
means 1
i 1
cannot 1
guess, 1
but 1
there 1
is 1
some 1
secret 1
business 1
going 1
on 1
in 1
this 1
house 1
of 1
gloom 1
which 1
sooner 1
or 1
later 1
we 1
shall 1
get 1
to 1
the 1
bottom 1
of. 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
trouble 1
you 1
with 1
my 1
theories, 1
for 1
you 1
asked 1
me 1
to 1
furnish 1
you 1
only 1
with 1
facts. 1
i 1
have 1
had 1
a 1
long 1
talk 1
with 1
sir 1
henry 1
this 1
morning, 1
and 1
we 1
have 1
made 1
a 1
plan 1
of 1
campaign 1
founded 1
upon 1
my 1
observations 1
of 1
last 1
night. 1
i 1
will 1
not 1
speak 1
about 1
it 1
just 1
now, 1
but 1
it 1
should 1
make 1
my 1
next 1
report 1
interesting 1
reading. 1
chapter 1
9. 1
the 1
light 1
upon 1
the 1
moor 1
[second 1
report 1
of 1
dr. 1
watson] 1
baskerville 1
hall, 1
oct. 1
15th. 1
my 1
dear 1
holmes, 1
if 1
i 1
was 1
compelled 1
to 1
leave 1
you 1
without 1
much 1
news 1
during 1
the 1
early 1
days 1
of 1
my 1
mission 1
you 1
must 1
acknowledge 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
making 1
up 1
for 1
lost 1
time, 1
and 1
that 1
events 1
are 1
now 1
crowding 1
thick 1
and 1
fast 1
upon 1
us. 1
in 1
my 1
last 1
report 1
i 1
ended 1
upon 1
my 1
top 1
note 1
with 1
barrymore 1
at 1
the 1
window, 1
and 1
now 1
i 1
have 1
quite 1
a 1
budget 1
already 1
which 1
will, 1
unless 1
i 1
am 1
much 1
mistaken, 1
considerably 1
surprise 1
you. 1
things 1
have 1
taken 1
a 1
turn 1
which 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
have 1
anticipated. 1
in 1
some 1
ways 1
they 1
have 1
within 1
the 1
last 1
forty-eight 1
hours 1
become 1
much 1
clearer 1
and 1
in 1
some 1
ways 1
they 1
have 1
become 1
more 1
complicated. 1
but 1
i 1
will 1
tell 1
you 1
all 1
and 1
you 1
shall 1
judge 1
for 1
yourself. 1
before 1
breakfast 1
on 1
the 1
morning 1
following 1
my 1
adventure 1
i 1
went 1
down 1
the 1
corridor 1
and 1
examined 1
the 1
room 1
in 1
which 1
barrymore 1
had 1
been 1
on 1
the 1
night 1
before. 1
the 1
western 1
window 1
through 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
stared 1
so 1
intently 1
has, 1
i 1
noticed, 1
one 1
peculiarity 1
above 1
all 1
other 1
windows 1
in 1
the 1
house—it 1
commands 1
the 1
nearest 1
outlook 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
moor. 1
there 1
is 1
an 1
opening 1
between 1
two 1
trees 1
which 1
enables 1
one 1
from 1
this 1
point 1
of 1
view 1
to 1
look 1
right 1
down 1
upon 1
it, 1
while 1
from 1
all 1
the 1
other 1
windows 1
it 1
is 1
only 1
a 1
distant 1
glimpse 1
which 1
can 1
be 1
obtained. 1
it 1
follows, 1
therefore, 1
that 1
barrymore, 1
since 1
only 1
this 1
window 1
would 1
serve 1
the 1
purpose, 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
looking 1
out 1
for 1
something 1
or 1
somebody 1
upon 1
the 1
moor. 1
the 1
night 1
was 1
very 1
dark, 1
so 1
that 1
i 1
can 1
hardly 1
imagine 1
how 1
he 1
could 1
have 1
hoped 1
to 1
see 1
anyone. 1
it 1
had 1
struck 1
me 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
possible 1
that 1
some 1
love 1
intrigue 1
was 1
on 1
foot. 1
that 1
would 1
have 1
accounted 1
for 1
his 1
stealthy 1
movements 1
and 1
also 1
for 1
the 1
uneasiness 1
of 1
his 1
wife. 1
the 1
man 1
is 1
a 1
striking-looking 1
fellow, 1
very 1
well 1
equipped 1
to 1
steal 1
the 1
heart 1
of 1
a 1
country 1
girl, 1
so 1
that 1
this 1
theory 1
seemed 1
to 1
have 1
something 1
to 1
support 1
it. 1
that 1
opening 1
of 1
the 1
door 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
heard 1
after 1
i 1
had 1
returned 1
to 1
my 1
room 1
might 1
mean 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
gone 1
out 1
to 1
keep 1
some 1
clandestine 1
appointment. 1
so 1
i 1
reasoned 1
with 1
myself 1
in 1
the 1
morning, 1
and 1
i 1
tell 1
you 1
the 1
direction 1
of 1
my 1
suspicions, 1
however 1
much 1
the 1
result 1
may 1
have 1
shown 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
unfounded. 1
but 1
whatever 1
the 1
true 1
explanation 1
of 1
barrymore’s 1
movements 1
might 1
be, 1
i 1
felt 1
that 1
the 1
responsibility 1
of 1
keeping 1
them 1
to 1
myself 1
until 1
i 1
could 1
explain 1
them 1
was 1
more 1
than 1
i 1
could 1
bear. 1
i 1
had 1
an 1
interview 1
with 1
the 1
baronet 1
in 1
his 1
study 1
after 1
breakfast, 1
and 1
i 1
told 1
him 1
all 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
seen. 1
he 1
was 1
less 1
surprised 1
than 1
i 1
had 1
expected. 1
“i 1
knew 1
that 1
barrymore 1
walked 1
about 1
nights, 1
and 1
i 1
had 1
a 1
mind 1
to 1
speak 1
to 1
him 1
about 1
it,” 1
said 1
he. 1
“two 1
or 1
three 1
times 1
i 1
have 1
heard 1
his 1
steps 1
in 1
the 1
passage, 1
coming 1
and 1
going, 1
just 1
about 1
the 1
hour 1
you 1
name.” 1
“perhaps 1
then 1
he 1
pays 1
a 1
visit 1
every 1
night 1
to 1
that 1
particular 1
window,” 1
i 1
suggested. 1
“perhaps 1
he 1
does. 1
if 1
so, 1
we 1
should 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
shadow 1
him 1
and 1
see 1
what 1
it 1
is 1
that 1
he 1
is 1
after. 1
i 1
wonder 1
what 1
your 1
friend 1
holmes 1
would 1
do 1
if 1
he 1
were 1
here.” 1
“i 1
believe 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
do 1
exactly 1
what 1
you 1
now 1
suggest,” 1
said 1
i. 1
“he 1
would 1
follow 1
barrymore 1
and 1
see 1
what 1
he 1
did.” 1
“then 1
we 1
shall 1
do 1
it 1
together.” 1
“but 1
surely 1
he 1
would 1
hear 1
us.” 1
“the 1
man 1
is 1
rather 1
deaf, 1
and 1
in 1
any 1
case 1
we 1
must 1
take 1
our 1
chance 1
of 1
that. 1
we’ll 1
sit 1
up 1
in 1
my 1
room 1
tonight 1
and 1
wait 1
until 1
he 1
passes.” 1
sir 1
henry 1
rubbed 1
his 1
hands 1
with 1
pleasure, 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
evident 1
that 1
he 1
hailed 1
the 1
adventure 1
as 1
a 1
relief 1
to 1
his 1
somewhat 1
quiet 1
life 1
upon 1
the 1
moor. 1
the 1
baronet 1
has 1
been 1
in 1
communication 1
with 1
the 1
architect 1
who 1
prepared 1
the 1
plans 1
for 1
sir 1
charles, 1
and 1
with 1
a 1
contractor 1
from 1
london, 1
so 1
that 1
we 1
may 1
expect 1
great 1
changes 1
to 1
begin 1
here 1
soon. 1
there 1
have 1
been 1
decorators 1
and 1
furnishers 1
up 1
from 1
plymouth, 1
and 1
it 1
is 1
evident 1
that 1
our 1
friend 1
has 1
large 1
ideas 1
and 1
means 1
to 1
spare 1
no 1
pains 1
or 1
expense 1
to 1
restore 1
the 1
grandeur 1
of 1
his 1
family. 1
when 1
the 1
house 1
is 1
renovated 1
and 1
refurnished, 1
all 1
that 1
he 1
will 1
need 1
will 1
be 1
a 1
wife 1
to 1
make 1
it 1
complete. 1
between 1
ourselves 1
there 1
are 1
pretty 1
clear 1
signs 1
that 1
this 1
will 1
not 1
be 1
wanting 1
if 1
the 1
lady 1
is 1
willing, 1
for 1
i 1
have 1
seldom 1
seen 1
a 1
man 1
more 1
infatuated 1
with 1
a 1
woman 1
than 1
he 1
is 1
with 1
our 1
beautiful 1
neighbour, 1
miss 1
stapleton. 1
and 1
yet 1
the 1
course 1
of 1
true 1
love 1
does 1
not 1
run 1
quite 1
as 1
smoothly 1
as 1
one 1
would 1
under 1
the 1
circumstances 1
expect. 1
today, 1
for 1
example, 1
its 1
surface 1
was 1
broken 1
by 1
a 1
very 1
unexpected 1
ripple, 1
which 1
has 1
caused 1
our 1
friend 1
considerable 1
perplexity 1
and 1
annoyance. 1
after 1
the 1
conversation 1
which 1
i 1
have 1
quoted 1
about 1
barrymore, 1
sir 1
henry 1
put 1
on 1
his 1
hat 1
and 1
prepared 1
to 1
go 1
out. 1
as 1
a 1
matter 1
of 1
course 1
i 1
did 1
the 1
same. 1
“what, 1
are 1
_you_ 1
coming, 1
watson?” 1
he 1
asked, 1
looking 1
at 1
me 1
in 1
a 1
curious 1
way. 1
“that 1
depends 1
on 1
whether 1
you 1
are 1
going 1
on 1
the 1
moor,” 1
said 1
i. 1
“yes, 1
i 1
am.” 1
“well, 1
you 1
know 1
what 1
my 1
instructions 1
are. 1
i 1
am 1
sorry 1
to 1
intrude, 1
but 1
you 1
heard 1
how 1
earnestly 1
holmes 1
insisted 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
not 1
leave 1
you, 1
and 1
especially 1
that 1
you 1
should 1
not 1
go 1
alone 1
upon 1
the 1
moor.” 1
sir 1
henry 1
put 1
his 1
hand 1
upon 1
my 1
shoulder 1
with 1
a 1
pleasant 1
smile. 1
“my 1
dear 1
fellow,” 1
said 1
he, 1
“holmes, 1
with 1
all 1
his 1
wisdom, 1
did 1
not 1
foresee 1
some 1
things 1
which 1
have 1
happened 1
since 1
i 1
have 1
been 1
on 1
the 1
moor. 1
you 1
understand 1
me? 1
i 1
am 1
sure 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
the 1
last 1
man 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
who 1
would 1
wish 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
spoil-sport. 1
i 1
must 1
go 1
out 1
alone.” 1
it 1
put 1
me 1
in 1
a 1
most 1
awkward 1
position. 1
i 1
was 1
at 1
a 1
loss 1
what 1
to 1
say 1
or 1
what 1
to 1
do, 1
and 1
before 1
i 1
had 1
made 1
up 1
my 1
mind 1
he 1
picked 1
up 1
his 1
cane 1
and 1
was 1
gone. 1
but 1
when 1
i 1
came 1
to 1
think 1
the 1
matter 1
over 1
my 1
conscience 1
reproached 1
me 1
bitterly 1
for 1
having 1
on 1
any 1
pretext 1
allowed 1
him 1
to 1
go 1
out 1
of 1
my 1
sight. 1
i 1
imagined 1
what 1
my 1
feelings 1
would 1
be 1
if 1
i 1
had 1
to 1
return 1
to 1
you 1
and 1
to 1
confess 1
that 1
some 1
misfortune 1
had 1
occurred 1
through 1
my 1
disregard 1
for 1
your 1
instructions. 1
i 1
assure 1
you 1
my 1
cheeks 1
flushed 1
at 1
the 1
very 1
thought. 1
it 1
might 1
not 1
even 1
now 1
be 1
too 1
late 1
to 1
overtake 1
him, 1
so 1
i 1
set 1
off 1
at 1
once 1
in 1
the 1
direction 1
of 1
merripit 1
house. 1
i 1
hurried 1
along 1
the 1
road 1
at 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
my 1
speed 1
without 1
seeing 1
anything 1
of 1
sir 1
henry, 1
until 1
i 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
point 1
where 1
the 1
moor 1
path 1
branches 1
off. 1
there, 1
fearing 1
that 1
perhaps 1
i 1
had 1
come 1
in 1
the 1
wrong 1
direction 1
after 1
all, 1
i 1
mounted 1
a 1
hill 1
from 1
which 1
i 1
could 1
command 1
a 1
view—the 1
same 1
hill 1
which 1
is 1
cut 1
into 1
the 1
dark 1
quarry. 1
thence 1
i 1
saw 1
him 1
at 1
once. 1
he 1
was 1
on 1
the 1
moor 1
path 1
about 1
a 1
quarter 1
of 1
a 1
mile 1
off, 1
and 1
a 1
lady 1
was 1
by 1
his 1
side 1
who 1
could 1
only 1
be 1
miss 1
stapleton. 1
it 1
was 1
clear 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
already 1
an 1
understanding 1
between 1
them 1
and 1
that 1
they 1
had 1
met 1
by 1
appointment. 1
they 1
were 1
walking 1
slowly 1
along 1
in 1
deep 1
conversation, 1
and 1
i 1
saw 1
her 1
making 1
quick 1
little 1
movements 1
of 1
her 1
hands 1
as 1
if 1
she 1
were 1
very 1
earnest 1
in 1
what 1
she 1
was 1
saying, 1
while 1
he 1
listened 1
intently, 1
and 1
once 1
or 1
twice 1
shook 1
his 1
head 1
in 1
strong 1
dissent. 1
i 1
stood 1
among 1
the 1
rocks 1
watching 1
them, 1
very 1
much 1
puzzled 1
as 1
to 1
what 1
i 1
should 1
do 1
next. 1
to 1
follow 1
them 1
and 1
break 1
into 1
their 1
intimate 1
conversation 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
an 1
outrage, 1
and 1
yet 1
my 1
clear 1
duty 1
was 1
never 1
for 1
an 1
instant 1
to 1
let 1
him 1
out 1
of 1
my 1
sight. 1
to 1
act 1
the 1
spy 1
upon 1
a 1
friend 1
was 1
a 1
hateful 1
task. 1
still, 1
i 1
could 1
see 1
no 1
better 1
course 1
than 1
to 1
observe 1
him 1
from 1
the 1
hill, 1
and 1
to 1
clear 1
my 1
conscience 1
by 1
confessing 1
to 1
him 1
afterwards 1
what 1
i 1
had 1
done. 1
it 1
is 1
true 1
that 1
if 1
any 1
sudden 1
danger 1
had 1
threatened 1
him 1
i 1
was 1
too 1
far 1
away 1
to 1
be 1
of 1
use, 1
and 1
yet 1
i 1
am 1
sure 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
agree 1
with 1
me 1
that 1
the 1
position 1
was 1
very 1
difficult, 1
and 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
nothing 1
more 1
which 1
i 1
could 1
do. 1
our 1
friend, 1
sir 1
henry, 1
and 1
the 1
lady 1
had 1
halted 1
on 1
the 1
path 1
and 1
were 1
standing 1
deeply 1
absorbed 1
in 1
their 1
conversation, 1
when 1
i 1
was 1
suddenly 1
aware 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
not 1
the 1
only 1
witness 1
of 1
their 1
interview. 1
a 1
wisp 1
of 1
green 1
floating 1
in 1
the 1
air 1
caught 1
my 1
eye, 1
and 1
another 1
glance 1
showed 1
me 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
carried 1
on 1
a 1
stick 1
by 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
was 1
moving 1
among 1
the 1
broken 1
ground. 1
it 1
was 1
stapleton 1
with 1
his 1
butterfly-net. 1
he 1
was 1
very 1
much 1
closer 1
to 1
the 1
pair 1
than 1
i 1
was, 1
and 1
he 1
appeared 1
to 1
be 1
moving 1
in 1
their 1
direction. 1
at 1
this 1
instant 1
sir 1
henry 1
suddenly 1
drew 1
miss 1
stapleton 1
to 1
his 1
side. 1
his 1
arm 1
was 1
round 1
her, 1
but 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
straining 1
away 1
from 1
him 1
with 1
her 1
face 1
averted. 1
he 1
stooped 1
his 1
head 1
to 1
hers, 1
and 1
she 1
raised 1
one 1
hand 1
as 1
if 1
in 1
protest. 1
next 1
moment 1
i 1
saw 1
them 1
spring 1
apart 1
and 1
turn 1
hurriedly 1
round. 1
stapleton 1
was 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
the 1
interruption. 1
he 1
was 1
running 1
wildly 1
towards 1
them, 1
his 1
absurd 1
net 1
dangling 1
behind 1
him. 1
he 1
gesticulated 1
and 1
almost 1
danced 1
with 1
excitement 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
lovers. 1
what 1
the 1
scene 1
meant 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
imagine, 1
but 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
stapleton 1
was 1
abusing 1
sir 1
henry, 1
who 1
offered 1
explanations, 1
which 1
became 1
more 1
angry 1
as 1
the 1
other 1
refused 1
to 1
accept 1
them. 1
the 1
lady 1
stood 1
by 1
in 1
haughty 1
silence. 1
finally 1
stapleton 1
turned 1
upon 1
his 1
heel 1
and 1
beckoned 1
in 1
a 1
peremptory 1
way 1
to 1
his 1
sister, 1
who, 1
after 1
an 1
irresolute 1
glance 1
at 1
sir 1
henry, 1
walked 1
off 1
by 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
her 1
brother. 1
the 1
naturalist’s 1
angry 1
gestures 1
showed 1
that 1
the 1
lady 1
was 1
included 1
in 1
his 1
displeasure. 1
the 1
baronet 1
stood 1
for 1
a 1
minute 1
looking 1
after 1
them, 1
and 1
then 1
he 1
walked 1
slowly 1
back 1
the 1
way 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
come, 1
his 1
head 1
hanging, 1
the 1
very 1
picture 1
of 1
dejection. 1
what 1
all 1
this 1
meant 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
imagine, 1
but 1
i 1
was 1
deeply 1
ashamed 1
to 1
have 1
witnessed 1
so 1
intimate 1
a 1
scene 1
without 1
my 1
friend’s 1
knowledge. 1
i 1
ran 1
down 1
the 1
hill 1
therefore 1
and 1
met 1
the 1
baronet 1
at 1
the 1
bottom. 1
his 1
face 1
was 1
flushed 1
with 1
anger 1
and 1
his 1
brows 1
were 1
wrinkled, 1
like 1
one 1
who 1
is 1
at 1
his 1
wit’s 1
ends 1
what 1
to 1
do. 1
“halloa, 1
watson! 1
where 1
have 1
you 1
dropped 1
from?” 1
said 1
he. 1
“you 1
don’t 1
mean 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
you 1
came 1
after 1
me 1
in 1
spite 1
of 1
all?” 1
i 1
explained 1
everything 1
to 1
him: 1
how 1
i 1
had 1
found 1
it 1
impossible 1
to 1
remain 1
behind, 1
how 1
i 1
had 1
followed 1
him, 1
and 1
how 1
i 1
had 1
witnessed 1
all 1
that 1
had 1
occurred. 1
for 1
an 1
instant 1
his 1
eyes 1
blazed 1
at 1
me, 1
but 1
my 1
frankness 1
disarmed 1
his 1
anger, 1
and 1
he 1
broke 1
at 1
last 1
into 1
a 1
rather 1
rueful 1
laugh. 1
“you 1
would 1
have 1
thought 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
that 1
prairie 1
a 1
fairly 1
safe 1
place 1
for 1
a 1
man 1
to 1
be 1
private,” 1
said 1
he, 1
“but, 1
by 1
thunder, 1
the 1
whole 1
countryside 1
seems 1
to 1
have 1
been 1
out 1
to 1
see 1
me 1
do 1
my 1
wooing—and 1
a 1
mighty 1
poor 1
wooing 1
at 1
that! 1
where 1
had 1
you 1
engaged 1
a 1
seat?” 1
“i 1
was 1
on 1
that 1
hill.” 1
“quite 1
in 1
the 1
back 1
row, 1
eh? 1
but 1
her 1
brother 1
was 1
well 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
front. 1
did 1
you 1
see 1
him 1
come 1
out 1
on 1
us?” 1
“yes, 1
i 1
did.” 1
“did 1
he 1
ever 1
strike 1
you 1
as 1
being 1
crazy—this 1
brother 1
of 1
hers?” 1
“i 1
can’t 1
say 1
that 1
he 1
ever 1
did.” 1
“i 1
dare 1
say 1
not. 1
i 1
always 1
thought 1
him 1
sane 1
enough 1
until 1
today, 1
but 1
you 1
can 1
take 1
it 1
from 1
me 1
that 1
either 1
he 1
or 1
i 1
ought 1
to 1
be 1
in 1
a 1
straitjacket. 1
what’s 1
the 1
matter 1
with 1
me, 1
anyhow? 1
you’ve 1
lived 1
near 1
me 1
for 1
some 1
weeks, 1
watson. 1
tell 1
me 1
straight, 1
now! 1
is 1
there 1
anything 1
that 1
would 1
prevent 1
me 1
from 1
making 1
a 1
good 1
husband 1
to 1
a 1
woman 1
that 1
i 1
loved?” 1
“i 1
should 1
say 1
not.” 1
“he 1
can’t 1
object 1
to 1
my 1
worldly 1
position, 1
so 1
it 1
must 1
be 1
myself 1
that 1
he 1
has 1
this 1
down 1
on. 1
what 1
has 1
he 1
against 1
me? 1
i 1
never 1
hurt 1
man 1
or 1
woman 1
in 1
my 1
life 1
that 1
i 1
know 1
of. 1
and 1
yet 1
he 1
would 1
not 1
so 1
much 1
as 1
let 1
me 1
touch 1
the 1
tips 1
of 1
her 1
fingers.” 1
“did 1
he 1
say 1
so?” 1
“that, 1
and 1
a 1
deal 1
more. 1
i 1
tell 1
you, 1
watson, 1
i’ve 1
only 1
known 1
her 1
these 1
few 1
weeks, 1
but 1
from 1
the 1
first 1
i 1
just 1
felt 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
made 1
for 1
me, 1
and 1
she, 1
too—she 1
was 1
happy 1
when 1
she 1
was 1
with 1
me, 1
and 1
that 1
i’ll 1
swear. 1
there’s 1
a 1
light 1
in 1
a 1
woman’s 1
eyes 1
that 1
speaks 1
louder 1
than 1
words. 1
but 1
he 1
has 1
never 1
let 1
us 1
get 1
together 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
only 1
today 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
that 1
i 1
saw 1
a 1
chance 1
of 1
having 1
a 1
few 1
words 1
with 1
her 1
alone. 1
she 1
was 1
glad 1
to 1
meet 1
me, 1
but 1
when 1
she 1
did 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
love 1
that 1
she 1
would 1
talk 1
about, 1
and 1
she 1
wouldn’t 1
have 1
let 1
me 1
talk 1
about 1
it 1
either 1
if 1
she 1
could 1
have 1
stopped 1
it. 1
she 1
kept 1
coming 1
back 1
to 1
it 1
that 1
this 1
was 1
a 1
place 1
of 1
danger, 1
and 1
that 1
she 1
would 1
never 1
be 1
happy 1
until 1
i 1
had 1
left 1
it. 1
i 1
told 1
her 1
that 1
since 1
i 1
had 1
seen 1
her 1
i 1
was 1
in 1
no 1
hurry 1
to 1
leave 1
it, 1
and 1
that 1
if 1
she 1
really 1
wanted 1
me 1
to 1
go, 1
the 1
only 1
way 1
to 1
work 1
it 1
was 1
for 1
her 1
to 1
arrange 1
to 1
go 1
with 1
me. 1
with 1
that 1
i 1
offered 1
in 1
as 1
many 1
words 1
to 1
marry 1
her, 1
but 1
before 1
she 1
could 1
answer, 1
down 1
came 1
this 1
brother 1
of 1
hers, 1
running 1
at 1
us 1
with 1
a 1
face 1
on 1
him 1
like 1
a 1
madman. 1
he 1
was 1
just 1
white 1
with 1
rage, 1
and 1
those 1
light 1
eyes 1
of 1
his 1
were 1
blazing 1
with 1
fury. 1
what 1
was 1
i 1
doing 1
with 1
the 1
lady? 1
how 1
dared 1
i 1
offer 1
her 1
attentions 1
which 1
were 1
distasteful 1
to 1
her? 1
did 1
i 1
think 1
that 1
because 1
i 1
was 1
a 1
baronet 1
i 1
could 1
do 1
what 1
i 1
liked? 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
her 1
brother 1
i 1
should 1
have 1
known 1
better 1
how 1
to 1
answer 1
him. 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
i 1
told 1
him 1
that 1
my 1
feelings 1
towards 1
his 1
sister 1
were 1
such 1
as 1
i 1
was 1
not 1
ashamed 1
of, 1
and 1
that 1
i 1
hoped 1
that 1
she 1
might 1
honour 1
me 1
by 1
becoming 1
my 1
wife. 1
that 1
seemed 1
to 1
make 1
the 1
matter 1
no 1
better, 1
so 1
then 1
i 1
lost 1
my 1
temper 1
too, 1
and 1
i 1
answered 1
him 1
rather 1
more 1
hotly 1
than 1
i 1
should 1
perhaps, 1
considering 1
that 1
she 1
was 1
standing 1
by. 1
so 1
it 1
ended 1
by 1
his 1
going 1
off 1
with 1
her, 1
as 1
you 1
saw, 1
and 1
here 1
am 1
i 1
as 1
badly 1
puzzled 1
a 1
man 1
as 1
any 1
in 1
this 1
county. 1
just 1
tell 1
me 1
what 1
it 1
all 1
means, 1
watson, 1
and 1
i’ll 1
owe 1
you 1
more 1
than 1
ever 1
i 1
can 1
hope 1
to 1
pay.” 1
i 1
tried 1
one 1
or 1
two 1
explanations, 1
but, 1
indeed, 1
i 1
was 1
completely 1
puzzled 1
myself. 1
our 1
friend’s 1
title, 1
his 1
fortune, 1
his 1
age, 1
his 1
character, 1
and 1
his 1
appearance 1
are 1
all 1
in 1
his 1
favour, 1
and 1
i 1
know 1
nothing 1
against 1
him 1
unless 1
it 1
be 1
this 1
dark 1
fate 1
which 1
runs 1
in 1
his 1
family. 1
that 1
his 1
advances 1
should 1
be 1
rejected 1
so 1
brusquely 1
without 1
any 1
reference 1
to 1
the 1
lady’s 1
own 1
wishes 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
lady 1
should 1
accept 1
the 1
situation 1
without 1
protest 1
is 1
very 1
amazing. 1
however, 1
our 1
conjectures 1
were 1
set 1
at 1
rest 1
by 1
a 1
visit 1
from 1
stapleton 1
himself 1
that 1
very 1
afternoon. 1
he 1
had 1
come 1
to 1
offer 1
apologies 1
for 1
his 1
rudeness 1
of 1
the 1
morning, 1
and 1
after 1
a 1
long 1
private 1
interview 1
with 1
sir 1
henry 1
in 1
his 1
study 1
the 1
upshot 1
of 1
their 1
conversation 1
was 1
that 1
the 1
breach 1
is 1
quite 1
healed, 1
and 1
that 1
we 1
are 1
to 1
dine 1
at 1
merripit 1
house 1
next 1
friday 1
as 1
a 1
sign 1
of 1
it. 1
“i 1
don’t 1
say 1
now 1
that 1
he 1
isn’t 1
a 1
crazy 1
man,” 1
said 1
sir 1
henry; 1
“i 1
can’t 1
forget 1
the 1
look 1
in 1
his 1
eyes 1
when 1
he 1
ran 1
at 1
me 1
this 1
morning, 1
but 1
i 1
must 1
allow 1
that 1
no 1
man 1
could 1
make 1
a 1
more 1
handsome 1
apology 1
than 1
he 1
has 1
done.” 1
“did 1
he 1
give 1
any 1
explanation 1
of 1
his 1
conduct?” 1
“his 1
sister 1
is 1
everything 1
in 1
his 1
life, 1
he 1
says. 1
that 1
is 1
natural 1
enough, 1
and 1
i 1
am 1
glad 1
that 1
he 1
should 1
understand 1
her 1
value. 1
they 1
have 1
always 1
been 1
together, 1
and 1
according 1
to 1
his 1
account 1
he 1
has 1
been 1
a 1
very 1
lonely 1
man 1
with 1
only 1
her 1
as 1
a 1
companion, 1
so 1
that 1
the 1
thought 1
of 1
losing 1
her 1
was 1
really 1
terrible 1
to 1
him. 1
he 1
had 1
not 1
understood, 1
he 1
said, 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
becoming 1
attached 1
to 1
her, 1
but 1
when 1
he 1
saw 1
with 1
his 1
own 1
eyes 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
really 1
so, 1
and 1
that 1
she 1
might 1
be 1
taken 1
away 1
from 1
him, 1
it 1
gave 1
him 1
such 1
a 1
shock 1
that 1
for 1
a 1
time 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
responsible 1
for 1
what 1
he 1
said 1
or 1
did. 1
he 1
was 1
very 1
sorry 1
for 1
all 1
that 1
had 1
passed, 1
and 1
he 1
recognized 1
how 1
foolish 1
and 1
how 1
selfish 1
it 1
was 1
that 1
he 1
should 1
imagine 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
hold 1
a 1
beautiful 1
woman 1
like 1
his 1
sister 1
to 1
himself 1
for 1
her 1
whole 1
life. 1
if 1
she 1
had 1
to 1
leave 1
him 1
he 1
had 1
rather 1
it 1
was 1
to 1
a 1
neighbour 1
like 1
myself 1
than 1
to 1
anyone 1
else. 1
but 1
in 1
any 1
case 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
blow 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
it 1
would 1
take 1
him 1
some 1
time 1
before 1
he 1
could 1
prepare 1
himself 1
to 1
meet 1
it. 1
he 1
would 1
withdraw 1
all 1
opposition 1
upon 1
his 1
part 1
if 1
i 1
would 1
promise 1
for 1
three 1
months 1
to 1
let 1
the 1
matter 1
rest 1
and 1
to 1
be 1
content 1
with 1
cultivating 1
the 1
lady’s 1
friendship 1
during 1
that 1
time 1
without 1
claiming 1
her 1
love. 1
this 1
i 1
promised, 1
and 1
so 1
the 1
matter 1
rests.” 1
so 1
there 1
is 1
one 1
of 1
our 1
small 1
mysteries 1
cleared 1
up. 1
it 1
is 1
something 1
to 1
have 1
touched 1
bottom 1
anywhere 1
in 1
this 1
bog 1
in 1
which 1
we 1
are 1
floundering. 1
we 1
know 1
now 1
why 1
stapleton 1
looked 1
with 1
disfavour 1
upon 1
his 1
sister’s 1
suitor—even 1
when 1
that 1
suitor 1
was 1
so 1
eligible 1
a 1
one 1
as 1
sir 1
henry. 1
and 1
now 1
i 1
pass 1
on 1
to 1
another 1
thread 1
which 1
i 1
have 1
extricated 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
tangled 1
skein, 1
the 1
mystery 1
of 1
the 1
sobs 1
in 1
the 1
night, 1
of 1
the 1
tear-stained 1
face 1
of 1
mrs. 1
barrymore, 1
of 1
the 1
secret 1
journey 1
of 1
the 1
butler 1
to 1
the 1
western 1
lattice 1
window. 1
congratulate 1
me, 1
my 1
dear 1
holmes, 1
and 1
tell 1
me 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
not 1
disappointed 1
you 1
as 1
an 1
agent—that 1
you 1
do 1
not 1
regret 1
the 1
confidence 1
which 1
you 1
showed 1
in 1
me 1
when 1
you 1
sent 1
me 1
down. 1
all 1
these 1
things 1
have 1
by 1
one 1
night’s 1
work 1
been 1
thoroughly 1
cleared. 1
i 1
have 1
said 1
“by 1
one 1
night’s 1
work,” 1
but, 1
in 1
truth, 1
it 1
was 1
by 1
two 1
nights’ 1
work, 1
for 1
on 1
the 1
first 1
we 1
drew 1
entirely 1
blank. 1
i 1
sat 1
up 1
with 1
sir 1
henry 1
in 1
his 1
rooms 1
until 1
nearly 1
three 1
o’clock 1
in 1
the 1
morning, 1
but 1
no 1
sound 1
of 1
any 1
sort 1
did 1
we 1
hear 1
except 1
the 1
chiming 1
clock 1
upon 1
the 1
stairs. 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
most 1
melancholy 1
vigil 1
and 1
ended 1
by 1
each 1
of 1
us 1
falling 1
asleep 1
in 1
our 1
chairs. 1
fortunately 1
we 1
were 1
not 1
discouraged, 1
and 1
we 1
determined 1
to 1
try 1
again. 1
the 1
next 1
night 1
we 1
lowered 1
the 1
lamp 1
and 1
sat 1
smoking 1
cigarettes 1
without 1
making 1
the 1
least 1
sound. 1
it 1
was 1
incredible 1
how 1
slowly 1
the 1
hours 1
crawled 1
by, 1
and 1
yet 1
we 1
were 1
helped 1
through 1
it 1
by 1
the 1
same 1
sort 1
of 1
patient 1
interest 1
which 1
the 1
hunter 1
must 1
feel 1
as 1
he 1
watches 1
the 1
trap 1
into 1
which 1
he 1
hopes 1
the 1
game 1
may 1
wander. 1
one 1
struck, 1
and 1
two, 1
and 1
we 1
had 1
almost 1
for 1
the 1
second 1
time 1
given 1
it 1
up 1
in 1
despair 1
when 1
in 1
an 1
instant 1
we 1
both 1
sat 1
bolt 1
upright 1
in 1
our 1
chairs 1
with 1
all 1
our 1
weary 1
senses 1
keenly 1
on 1
the 1
alert 1
once 1
more. 1
we 1
had 1
heard 1
the 1
creak 1
of 1
a 1
step 1
in 1
the 1
passage. 1
very 1
stealthily 1
we 1
heard 1
it 1
pass 1
along 1
until 1
it 1
died 1
away 1
in 1
the 1
distance. 1
then 1
the 1
baronet 1
gently 1
opened 1
his 1
door 1
and 1
we 1
set 1
out 1
in 1
pursuit. 1
already 1
our 1
man 1
had 1
gone 1
round 1
the 1
gallery 1
and 1
the 1
corridor 1
was 1
all 1
in 1
darkness. 1
softly 1
we 1
stole 1
along 1
until 1
we 1
had 1
come 1
into 1
the 1
other 1
wing. 1
we 1
were 1
just 1
in 1
time 1
to 1
catch 1
a 1
glimpse 1
of 1
the 1
tall, 1
black-bearded 1
figure, 1
his 1
shoulders 1
rounded 1
as 1
he 1
tiptoed 1
down 1
the 1
passage. 1
then 1
he 1
passed 1
through 1
the 1
same 1
door 1
as 1
before, 1
and 1
the 1
light 1
of 1
the 1
candle 1
framed 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
darkness 1
and 1
shot 1
one 1
single 1
yellow 1
beam 1
across 1
the 1
gloom 1
of 1
the 1
corridor. 1
we 1
shuffled 1
cautiously 1
towards 1
it, 1
trying 1
every 1
plank 1
before 1
we 1
dared 1
to 1
put 1
our 1
whole 1
weight 1
upon 1
it. 1
we 1
had 1
taken 1
the 1
precaution 1
of 1
leaving 1
our 1
boots 1
behind 1
us, 1
but, 1
even 1
so, 1
the 1
old 1
boards 1
snapped 1
and 1
creaked 1
beneath 1
our 1
tread. 1
sometimes 1
it 1
seemed 1
impossible 1
that 1
he 1
should 1
fail 1
to 1
hear 1
our 1
approach. 1
however, 1
the 1
man 1
is 1
fortunately 1
rather 1
deaf, 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
entirely 1
preoccupied 1
in 1
that 1
which 1
he 1
was 1
doing. 1
when 1
at 1
last 1
we 1
reached 1
the 1
door 1
and 1
peeped 1
through 1
we 1
found 1
him 1
crouching 1
at 1
the 1
window, 1
candle 1
in 1
hand, 1
his 1
white, 1
intent 1
face 1
pressed 1
against 1
the 1
pane, 1
exactly 1
as 1
i 1
had 1
seen 1
him 1
two 1
nights 1
before. 1
we 1
had 1
arranged 1
no 1
plan 1
of 1
campaign, 1
but 1
the 1
baronet 1
is 1
a 1
man 1
to 1
whom 1
the 1
most 1
direct 1
way 1
is 1
always 1
the 1
most 1
natural. 1
he 1
walked 1
into 1
the 1
room, 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
did 1
so 1
barrymore 1
sprang 1
up 1
from 1
the 1
window 1
with 1
a 1
sharp 1
hiss 1
of 1
his 1
breath 1
and 1
stood, 1
livid 1
and 1
trembling, 1
before 1
us. 1
his 1
dark 1
eyes, 1
glaring 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
white 1
mask 1
of 1
his 1
face, 1
were 1
full 1
of 1
horror 1
and 1
astonishment 1
as 1
he 1
gazed 1
from 1
sir 1
henry 1
to 1
me. 1
“what 1
are 1
you 1
doing 1
here, 1
barrymore?” 1
“nothing, 1
sir.” 1
his 1
agitation 1
was 1
so 1
great 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
hardly 1
speak, 1
and 1
the 1
shadows 1
sprang 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
from 1
the 1
shaking 1
of 1
his 1
candle. 1
“it 1
was 1
the 1
window, 1
sir. 1
i 1
go 1
round 1
at 1
night 1
to 1
see 1
that 1
they 1
are 1
fastened.” 1
“on 1
the 1
second 1
floor?” 1
“yes, 1
sir, 1
all 1
the 1
windows.” 1
“look 1
here, 1
barrymore,” 1
said 1
sir 1
henry 1
sternly, 1
“we 1
have 1
made 1
up 1
our 1
minds 1
to 1
have 1
the 1
truth 1
out 1
of 1
you, 1
so 1
it 1
will 1
save 1
you 1
trouble 1
to 1
tell 1
it 1
sooner 1
rather 1
than 1
later. 1
come, 1
now! 1
no 1
lies! 1
what 1
were 1
you 1
doing 1
at 1
that 1
window?” 1
the 1
fellow 1
looked 1
at 1
us 1
in 1
a 1
helpless 1
way, 1
and 1
he 1
wrung 1
his 1
hands 1
together 1
like 1
one 1
who 1
is 1
in 1
the 1
last 1
extremity 1
of 1
doubt 1
and 1
misery. 1
“i 1
was 1
doing 1
no 1
harm, 1
sir. 1
i 1
was 1
holding 1
a 1
candle 1
to 1
the 1
window.” 1
“and 1
why 1
were 1
you 1
holding 1
a 1
candle 1
to 1
the 1
window?” 1
“don’t 1
ask 1
me, 1
sir 1
henry—don’t 1
ask 1
me! 1
i 1
give 1
you 1
my 1
word, 1
sir, 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
my 1
secret, 1
and 1
that 1
i 1
cannot 1
tell 1
it. 1
if 1
it 1
concerned 1
no 1
one 1
but 1
myself 1
i 1
would 1
not 1
try 1
to 1
keep 1
it 1
from 1
you.” 1
a 1
sudden 1
idea 1
occurred 1
to 1
me, 1
and 1
i 1
took 1
the 1
candle 1
from 1
the 1
trembling 1
hand 1
of 1
the 1
butler. 1
“he 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
holding 1
it 1
as 1
a 1
signal,” 1
said 1
i. 1
“let 1
us 1
see 1
if 1
there 1
is 1
any 1
answer.” 1
i 1
held 1
it 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
done, 1
and 1
stared 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
darkness 1
of 1
the 1
night. 1
vaguely 1
i 1
could 1
discern 1
the 1
black 1
bank 1
of 1
the 1
trees 1
and 1
the 1
lighter 1
expanse 1
of 1
the 1
moor, 1
for 1
the 1
moon 1
was 1
behind 1
the 1
clouds. 1
and 1
then 1
i 1
gave 1
a 1
cry 1
of 1
exultation, 1
for 1
a 1
tiny 1
pinpoint 1
of 1
yellow 1
light 1
had 1
suddenly 1
transfixed 1
the 1
dark 1
veil, 1
and 1
glowed 1
steadily 1
in 1
the 1
centre 1
of 1
the 1
black 1
square 1
framed 1
by 1
the 1
window. 1
“there 1
it 1
is!” 1
i 1
cried. 1
“no, 1
no, 1
sir, 1
it 1
is 1
nothing—nothing 1
at 1
all!” 1
the 1
butler 1
broke 1
in; 1
“i 1
assure 1
you, 1
sir—” 1
“move 1
your 1
light 1
across 1
the 1
window, 1
watson!” 1
cried 1
the 1
baronet. 1
“see, 1
the 1
other 1
moves 1
also! 1
now, 1
you 1
rascal, 1
do 1
you 1
deny 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
signal? 1
come, 1
speak 1
up! 1
who 1
is 1
your 1
confederate 1
out 1
yonder, 1
and 1
what 1
is 1
this 1
conspiracy 1
that 1
is 1
going 1
on?” 1
the 1
man’s 1
face 1
became 1
openly 1
defiant. 1
“it 1
is 1
my 1
business, 1
and 1
not 1
yours. 1
i 1
will 1
not 1
tell.” 1
“then 1
you 1
leave 1
my 1
employment 1
right 1
away.” 1
“very 1
good, 1
sir. 1
if 1
i 1
must 1
i 1
must.” 1
“and 1
you 1
go 1
in 1
disgrace. 1
by 1
thunder, 1
you 1
may 1
well 1
be 1
ashamed 1
of 1
yourself. 1
your 1
family 1
has 1
lived 1
with 1
mine 1
for 1
over 1
a 1
hundred 1
years 1
under 1
this 1
roof, 1
and 1
here 1
i 1
find 1
you 1
deep 1
in 1
some 1
dark 1
plot 1
against 1
me.” 1
“no, 1
no, 1
sir; 1
no, 1
not 1
against 1
you!” 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
woman’s 1
voice, 1
and 1
mrs. 1
barrymore, 1
paler 1
and 1
more 1
horror-struck 1
than 1
her 1
husband, 1
was 1
standing 1
at 1
the 1
door. 1
her 1
bulky 1
figure 1
in 1
a 1
shawl 1
and 1
skirt 1
might 1
have 1
been 1
comic 1
were 1
it 1
not 1
for 1
the 1
intensity 1
of 1
feeling 1
upon 1
her 1
face. 1
“we 1
have 1
to 1
go, 1
eliza. 1
this 1
is 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
it. 1
you 1
can 1
pack 1
our 1
things,” 1
said 1
the 1
butler. 1
“oh, 1
john, 1
john, 1
have 1
i 1
brought 1
you 1
to 1
this? 1
it 1
is 1
my 1
doing, 1
sir 1
henry—all 1
mine. 1
he 1
has 1
done 1
nothing 1
except 1
for 1
my 1
sake 1
and 1
because 1
i 1
asked 1
him.” 1
“speak 1
out, 1
then! 1
what 1
does 1
it 1
mean?” 1
“my 1
unhappy 1
brother 1
is 1
starving 1
on 1
the 1
moor. 1
we 1
cannot 1
let 1
him 1
perish 1
at 1
our 1
very 1
gates. 1
the 1
light 1
is 1
a 1
signal 1
to 1
him 1
that 1
food 1
is 1
ready 1
for 1
him, 1
and 1
his 1
light 1
out 1
yonder 1
is 1
to 1
show 1
the 1
spot 1
to 1
which 1
to 1
bring 1
it.” 1
“then 1
your 1
brother 1
is—” 1
“the 1
escaped 1
convict, 1
sir—selden, 1
the 1
criminal.” 1
“that’s 1
the 1
truth, 1
sir,” 1
said 1
barrymore. 1
“i 1
said 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
my 1
secret 1
and 1
that 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
tell 1
it 1
to 1
you. 1
but 1
now 1
you 1
have 1
heard 1
it, 1
and 1
you 1
will 1
see 1
that 1
if 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
plot 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
against 1
you.” 1
this, 1
then, 1
was 1
the 1
explanation 1
of 1
the 1
stealthy 1
expeditions 1
at 1
night 1
and 1
the 1
light 1
at 1
the 1
window. 1
sir 1
henry 1
and 1
i 1
both 1
stared 1
at 1
the 1
woman 1
in 1
amazement. 1
was 1
it 1
possible 1
that 1
this 1
stolidly 1
respectable 1
person 1
was 1
of 1
the 1
same 1
blood 1
as 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
notorious 1
criminals 1
in 1
the 1
country? 1
“yes, 1
sir, 1
my 1
name 1
was 1
selden, 1
and 1
he 1
is 1
my 1
younger 1
brother. 1
we 1
humoured 1
him 1
too 1
much 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
lad 1
and 1
gave 1
him 1
his 1
own 1
way 1
in 1
everything 1
until 1
he 1
came 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
the 1
world 1
was 1
made 1
for 1
his 1
pleasure, 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
do 1
what 1
he 1
liked 1
in 1
it. 1
then 1
as 1
he 1
grew 1
older 1
he 1
met 1
wicked 1
companions, 1
and 1
the 1
devil 1
entered 1
into 1
him 1
until 1
he 1
broke 1
my 1
mother’s 1
heart 1
and 1
dragged 1
our 1
name 1
in 1
the 1
dirt. 1
from 1
crime 1
to 1
crime 1
he 1
sank 1
lower 1
and 1
lower 1
until 1
it 1
is 1
only 1
the 1
mercy 1
of 1
god 1
which 1
has 1
snatched 1
him 1
from 1
the 1
scaffold; 1
but 1
to 1
me, 1
sir, 1
he 1
was 1
always 1
the 1
little 1
curly-headed 1
boy 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
nursed 1
and 1
played 1
with 1
as 1
an 1
elder 1
sister 1
would. 1
that 1
was 1
why 1
he 1
broke 1
prison, 1
sir. 1
he 1
knew 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
here 1
and 1
that 1
we 1
could 1
not 1
refuse 1
to 1
help 1
him. 1
when 1
he 1
dragged 1
himself 1
here 1
one 1
night, 1
weary 1
and 1
starving, 1
with 1
the 1
warders 1
hard 1
at 1
his 1
heels, 1
what 1
could 1
we 1
do? 1
we 1
took 1
him 1
in 1
and 1
fed 1
him 1
and 1
cared 1
for 1
him. 1
then 1
you 1
returned, 1
sir, 1
and 1
my 1
brother 1
thought 1
he 1
would 1
be 1
safer 1
on 1
the 1
moor 1
than 1
anywhere 1
else 1
until 1
the 1
hue 1
and 1
cry 1
was 1
over, 1
so 1
he 1
lay 1
in 1
hiding 1
there. 1
but 1
every 1
second 1
night 1
we 1
made 1
sure 1
if 1
he 1
was 1
still 1
there 1
by 1
putting 1
a 1
light 1
in 1
the 1
window, 1
and 1
if 1
there 1
was 1
an 1
answer 1
my 1
husband 1
took 1
out 1
some 1
bread 1
and 1
meat 1
to 1
him. 1
every 1
day 1
we 1
hoped 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
gone, 1
but 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
there 1
we 1
could 1
not 1
desert 1
him. 1
that 1
is 1
the 1
whole 1
truth, 1
as 1
i 1
am 1
an 1
honest 1
christian 1
woman 1
and 1
you 1
will 1
see 1
that 1
if 1
there 1
is 1
blame 1
in 1
the 1
matter 1
it 1
does 1
not 1
lie 1
with 1
my 1
husband 1
but 1
with 1
me, 1
for 1
whose 1
sake 1
he 1
has 1
done 1
all 1
that 1
he 1
has.” 1
the 1
woman’s 1
words 1
came 1
with 1
an 1
intense 1
earnestness 1
which 1
carried 1
conviction 1
with 1
them. 1
“is 1
this 1
true, 1
barrymore?” 1
“yes, 1
sir 1
henry. 1
every 1
word 1
of 1
it.” 1
“well, 1
i 1
cannot 1
blame 1
you 1
for 1
standing 1
by 1
your 1
own 1
wife. 1
forget 1
what 1
i 1
have 1
said. 1
go 1
to 1
your 1
room, 1
you 1
two, 1
and 1
we 1
shall 1
talk 1
further 1
about 1
this 1
matter 1
in 1
the 1
morning.” 1
when 1
they 1
were 1
gone 1
we 1
looked 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
window 1
again. 1
sir 1
henry 1
had 1
flung 1
it 1
open, 1
and 1
the 1
cold 1
night 1
wind 1
beat 1
in 1
upon 1
our 1
faces. 1
far 1
away 1
in 1
the 1
black 1
distance 1
there 1
still 1
glowed 1
that 1
one 1
tiny 1
point 1
of 1
yellow 1
light. 1
“i 1
wonder 1
he 1
dares,” 1
said 1
sir 1
henry. 1
“it 1
may 1
be 1
so 1
placed 1
as 1
to 1
be 1
only 1
visible 1
from 1
here.” 1
“very 1
likely. 1
how 1
far 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
it 1
is?” 1
“out 1
by 1
the 1
cleft 1
tor, 1
i 1
think.” 1
“not 1
more 1
than 1
a 1
mile 1
or 1
two 1
off.” 1
“hardly 1
that.” 1
“well, 1
it 1
cannot 1
be 1
far 1
if 1
barrymore 1
had 1
to 1
carry 1
out 1
the 1
food 1
to 1
it. 1
and 1
he 1
is 1
waiting, 1
this 1
villain, 1
beside 1
that 1
candle. 1
by 1
thunder, 1
watson, 1
i 1
am 1
going 1
out 1
to 1
take 1
that 1
man!” 1
the 1
same 1
thought 1
had 1
crossed 1
my 1
own 1
mind. 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
as 1
if 1
the 1
barrymores 1
had 1
taken 1
us 1
into 1
their 1
confidence. 1
their 1
secret 1
had 1
been 1
forced 1
from 1
them. 1
the 1
man 1
was 1
a 1
danger 1
to 1
the 1
community, 1
an 1
unmitigated 1
scoundrel 1
for 1
whom 1
there 1
was 1
neither 1
pity 1
nor 1
excuse. 1
we 1
were 1
only 1
doing 1
our 1
duty 1
in 1
taking 1
this 1
chance 1
of 1
putting 1
him 1
back 1
where 1
he 1
could 1
do 1
no 1
harm. 1
with 1
his 1
brutal 1
and 1
violent 1
nature, 1
others 1
would 1
have 1
to 1
pay 1
the 1
price 1
if 1
we 1
held 1
our 1
hands. 1
any 1
night, 1
for 1
example, 1
our 1
neighbours 1
the 1
stapletons 1
might 1
be 1
attacked 1
by 1
him, 1
and 1
it 1
may 1
have 1
been 1
the 1
thought 1
of 1
this 1
which 1
made 1
sir 1
henry 1
so 1
keen 1
upon 1
the 1
adventure. 1
“i 1
will 1
come,” 1
said 1
i. 1
“then 1
get 1
your 1
revolver 1
and 1
put 1
on 1
your 1
boots. 1
the 1
sooner 1
we 1
start 1
the 1
better, 1
as 1
the 1
fellow 1
may 1
put 1
out 1
his 1
light 1
and 1
be 1
off.” 1
in 1
five 1
minutes 1
we 1
were 1
outside 1
the 1
door, 1
starting 1
upon 1
our 1
expedition. 1
we 1
hurried 1
through 1
the 1
dark 1
shrubbery, 1
amid 1
the 1
dull 1
moaning 1
of 1
the 1
autumn 1
wind 1
and 1
the 1
rustle 1
of 1
the 1
falling 1
leaves. 1
the 1
night 1
air 1
was 1
heavy 1
with 1
the 1
smell 1
of 1
damp 1
and 1
decay. 1
now 1
and 1
again 1
the 1
moon 1
peeped 1
out 1
for 1
an 1
instant, 1
but 1
clouds 1
were 1
driving 1
over 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
the 1
sky, 1
and 1
just 1
as 1
we 1
came 1
out 1
on 1
the 1
moor 1
a 1
thin 1
rain 1
began 1
to 1
fall. 1
the 1
light 1
still 1
burned 1
steadily 1
in 1
front. 1
“are 1
you 1
armed?” 1
i 1
asked. 1
“i 1
have 1
a 1
hunting-crop.” 1
“we 1
must 1
close 1
in 1
on 1
him 1
rapidly, 1
for 1
he 1
is 1
said 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
desperate 1
fellow. 1
we 1
shall 1
take 1
him 1
by 1
surprise 1
and 1
have 1
him 1
at 1
our 1
mercy 1
before 1
he 1
can 1
resist.” 1
“i 1
say, 1
watson,” 1
said 1
the 1
baronet, 1
“what 1
would 1
holmes 1
say 1
to 1
this? 1
how 1
about 1
that 1
hour 1
of 1
darkness 1
in 1
which 1
the 1
power 1
of 1
evil 1
is 1
exalted?” 1
as 1
if 1
in 1
answer 1
to 1
his 1
words 1
there 1
rose 1
suddenly 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
vast 1
gloom 1
of 1
the 1
moor 1
that 1
strange 1
cry 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
already 1
heard 1
upon 1
the 1
borders 1
of 1
the 1
great 1
grimpen 1
mire. 1
it 1
came 1
with 1
the 1
wind 1
through 1
the 1
silence 1
of 1
the 1
night, 1
a 1
long, 1
deep 1
mutter, 1
then 1
a 1
rising 1
howl, 1
and 1
then 1
the 1
sad 1
moan 1
in 1
which 1
it 1
died 1
away. 1
again 1
and 1
again 1
it 1
sounded, 1
the 1
whole 1
air 1
throbbing 1
with 1
it, 1
strident, 1
wild, 1
and 1
menacing. 1
the 1
baronet 1
caught 1
my 1
sleeve 1
and 1
his 1
face 1
glimmered 1
white 1
through 1
the 1
darkness. 1
“my 1
god, 1
what’s 1
that, 1
watson?” 1
“i 1
don’t 1
know. 1
it’s 1
a 1
sound 1
they 1
have 1
on 1
the 1
moor. 1
i 1
heard 1
it 1
once 1
before.” 1
it 1
died 1
away, 1
and 1
an 1
absolute 1
silence 1
closed 1
in 1
upon 1
us. 1
we 1
stood 1
straining 1
our 1
ears, 1
but 1
nothing 1
came. 1
“watson,” 1
said 1
the 1
baronet, 1
“it 1
was 1
the 1
cry 1
of 1
a 1
hound.” 1
my 1
blood 1
ran 1
cold 1
in 1
my 1
veins, 1
for 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
break 1
in 1
his 1
voice 1
which 1
told 1
of 1
the 1
sudden 1
horror 1
which 1
had 1
seized 1
him. 1
“what 1
do 1
they 1
call 1
this 1
sound?” 1
he 1
asked. 1
“who?” 1
“the 1
folk 1
on 1
the 1
countryside.” 1
“oh, 1
they 1
are 1
ignorant 1
people. 1
why 1
should 1
you 1
mind 1
what 1
they 1
call 1
it?” 1
“tell 1
me, 1
watson. 1
what 1
do 1
they 1
say 1
of 1
it?” 1
i 1
hesitated 1
but 1
could 1
not 1
escape 1
the 1
question. 1
“they 1
say 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
cry 1
of 1
the 1
hound 1
of 1
the 1
baskervilles.” 1
he 1
groaned 1
and 1
was 1
silent 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
moments. 1
“a 1
hound 1
it 1
was,” 1
he 1
said 1
at 1
last, 1
“but 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
come 1
from 1
miles 1
away, 1
over 1
yonder, 1
i 1
think.” 1
“it 1
was 1
hard 1
to 1
say 1
whence 1
it 1
came.” 1
“it 1
rose 1
and 1
fell 1
with 1
the 1
wind. 1
isn’t 1
that 1
the 1
direction 1
of 1
the 1
great 1
grimpen 1
mire?” 1
“yes, 1
it 1
is.” 1
“well, 1
it 1
was 1
up 1
there. 1
come 1
now, 1
watson, 1
didn’t 1
you 1
think 1
yourself 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
cry 1
of 1
a 1
hound? 1
i 1
am 1
not 1
a 1
child. 1
you 1
need 1
not 1
fear 1
to 1
speak 1
the 1
truth.” 1
“stapleton 1
was 1
with 1
me 1
when 1
i 1
heard 1
it 1
last. 1
he 1
said 1
that 1
it 1
might 1
be 1
the 1
calling 1
of 1
a 1
strange 1
bird.” 1
“no, 1
no, 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
hound. 1
my 1
god, 1
can 1
there 1
be 1
some 1
truth 1
in 1
all 1
these 1
stories? 1
is 1
it 1
possible 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
really 1
in 1
danger 1
from 1
so 1
dark 1
a 1
cause? 1
you 1
don’t 1
believe 1
it, 1
do 1
you, 1
watson?” 1
“no, 1
no.” 1
“and 1
yet 1
it 1
was 1
one 1
thing 1
to 1
laugh 1
about 1
it 1
in 1
london, 1
and 1
it 1
is 1
another 1
to 1
stand 1
out 1
here 1
in 1
the 1
darkness 1
of 1
the 1
moor 1
and 1
to 1
hear 1
such 1
a 1
cry 1
as 1
that. 1
and 1
my 1
uncle! 1
there 1
was 1
the 1
footprint 1
of 1
the 1
hound 1
beside 1
him 1
as 1
he 1
lay. 1
it 1
all 1
fits 1
together. 1
i 1
don’t 1
think 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
a 1
coward, 1
watson, 1
but 1
that 1
sound 1
seemed 1
to 1
freeze 1
my 1
very 1
blood. 1
feel 1
my 1
hand!” 1
it 1
was 1
as 1
cold 1
as 1
a 1
block 1
of 1
marble. 1
“you’ll 1
be 1
all 1
right 1
tomorrow.” 1
“i 1
don’t 1
think 1
i’ll 1
get 1
that 1
cry 1
out 1
of 1
my 1
head. 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
advise 1
that 1
we 1
do 1
now?” 1
“shall 1
we 1
turn 1
back?” 1
“no, 1
by 1
thunder; 1
we 1
have 1
come 1
out 1
to 1
get 1
our 1
man, 1
and 1
we 1
will 1
do 1
it. 1
we 1
after 1
the 1
convict, 1
and 1
a 1
hell-hound, 1
as 1
likely 1
as 1
not, 1
after 1
us. 1
come 1
on! 1
we’ll 1
see 1
it 1
through 1
if 1
all 1
the 1
fiends 1
of 1
the 1
pit 1
were 1
loose 1
upon 1
the 1
moor.” 1
we 1
stumbled 1
slowly 1
along 1
in 1
the 1
darkness, 1
with 1
the 1
black 1
loom 1
of 1
the 1
craggy 1
hills 1
around 1
us, 1
and 1
the 1
yellow 1
speck 1
of 1
light 1
burning 1
steadily 1
in 1
front. 1
there 1
is 1
nothing 1
so 1
deceptive 1
as 1
the 1
distance 1
of 1
a 1
light 1
upon 1
a 1
pitch-dark 1
night, 1
and 1
sometimes 1
the 1
glimmer 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
far 1
away 1
upon 1
the 1
horizon 1
and 1
sometimes 1
it 1
might 1
have 1
been 1
within 1
a 1
few 1
yards 1
of 1
us. 1
but 1
at 1
last 1
we 1
could 1
see 1
whence 1
it 1
came, 1
and 1
then 1
we 1
knew 1
that 1
we 1
were 1
indeed 1
very 1
close. 1
a 1
guttering 1
candle 1
was 1
stuck 1
in 1
a 1
crevice 1
of 1
the 1
rocks 1
which 1
flanked 1
it 1
on 1
each 1
side 1
so 1
as 1
to 1
keep 1
the 1
wind 1
from 1
it 1
and 1
also 1
to 1
prevent 1
it 1
from 1
being 1
visible, 1
save 1
in 1
the 1
direction 1
of 1
baskerville 1
hall. 1
a 1
boulder 1
of 1
granite 1
concealed 1
our 1
approach, 1
and 1
crouching 1
behind 1
it 1
we 1
gazed 1
over 1
it 1
at 1
the 1
signal 1
light. 1
it 1
was 1
strange 1
to 1
see 1
this 1
single 1
candle 1
burning 1
there 1
in 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
moor, 1
with 1
no 1
sign 1
of 1
life 1
near 1
it—just 1
the 1
one 1
straight 1
yellow 1
flame 1
and 1
the 1
gleam 1
of 1
the 1
rock 1
on 1
each 1
side 1
of 1
it. 1
“what 1
shall 1
we 1
do 1
now?” 1
whispered 1
sir 1
henry. 1
“wait 1
here. 1
he 1
must 1
be 1
near 1
his 1
light. 1
let 1
us 1
see 1
if 1
we 1
can 1
get 1
a 1
glimpse 1
of 1
him.” 1
the 1
words 1
were 1
hardly 1
out 1
of 1
my 1
mouth 1
when 1
we 1
both 1
saw 1
him. 1
over 1
the 1
rocks, 1
in 1
the 1
crevice 1
of 1
which 1
the 1
candle 1
burned, 1
there 1
was 1
thrust 1
out 1
an 1
evil 1
yellow 1
face, 1
a 1
terrible 1
animal 1
face, 1
all 1
seamed 1
and 1
scored 1
with 1
vile 1
passions. 1
foul 1
with 1
mire, 1
with 1
a 1
bristling 1
beard, 1
and 1
hung 1
with 1
matted 1
hair, 1
it 1
might 1
well 1
have 1
belonged 1
to 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
old 1
savages 1
who 1
dwelt 1
in 1
the 1
burrows 1
on 1
the 1
hillsides. 1
the 1
light 1
beneath 1
him 1
was 1
reflected 1
in 1
his 1
small, 1
cunning 1
eyes 1
which 1
peered 1
fiercely 1
to 1
right 1
and 1
left 1
through 1
the 1
darkness 1
like 1
a 1
crafty 1
and 1
savage 1
animal 1
who 1
has 1
heard 1
the 1
steps 1
of 1
the 1
hunters. 1
something 1
had 1
evidently 1
aroused 1
his 1
suspicions. 1
it 1
may 1
have 1
been 1
that 1
barrymore 1
had 1
some 1
private 1
signal 1
which 1
we 1
had 1
neglected 1
to 1
give, 1
or 1
the 1
fellow 1
may 1
have 1
had 1
some 1
other 1
reason 1
for 1
thinking 1
that 1
all 1
was 1
not 1
well, 1
but 1
i 1
could 1
read 1
his 1
fears 1
upon 1
his 1
wicked 1
face. 1
any 1
instant 1
he 1
might 1
dash 1
out 1
the 1
light 1
and 1
vanish 1
in 1
the 1
darkness. 1
i 1
sprang 1
forward 1
therefore, 1
and 1
sir 1
henry 1
did 1
the 1
same. 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
moment 1
the 1
convict 1
screamed 1
out 1
a 1
curse 1
at 1
us 1
and 1
hurled 1
a 1
rock 1
which 1
splintered 1
up 1
against 1
the 1
boulder 1
which 1
had 1
sheltered 1
us. 1
i 1
caught 1
one 1
glimpse 1
of 1
his 1
short, 1
squat, 1
strongly 1
built 1
figure 1
as 1
he 1
sprang 1
to 1
his 1
feet 1
and 1
turned 1
to 1
run. 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
moment 1
by 1
a 1
lucky 1
chance 1
the 1
moon 1
broke 1
through 1
the 1
clouds. 1
we 1
rushed 1
over 1
the 1
brow 1
of 1
the 1
hill, 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
our 1
man 1
running 1
with 1
great 1
speed 1
down 1
the 1
other 1
side, 1
springing 1
over 1
the 1
stones 1
in 1
his 1
way 1
with 1
the 1
activity 1
of 1
a 1
mountain 1
goat. 1
a 1
lucky 1
long 1
shot 1
of 1
my 1
revolver 1
might 1
have 1
crippled 1
him, 1
but 1
i 1
had 1
brought 1
it 1
only 1
to 1
defend 1
myself 1
if 1
attacked 1
and 1
not 1
to 1
shoot 1
an 1
unarmed 1
man 1
who 1
was 1
running 1
away. 1
we 1
were 1
both 1
swift 1
runners 1
and 1
in 1
fairly 1
good 1
training, 1
but 1
we 1
soon 1
found 1
that 1
we 1
had 1
no 1
chance 1
of 1
overtaking 1
him. 1
we 1
saw 1
him 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
in 1
the 1
moonlight 1
until 1
he 1
was 1
only 1
a 1
small 1
speck 1
moving 1
swiftly 1
among 1
the 1
boulders 1
upon 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
a 1
distant 1
hill. 1
we 1
ran 1
and 1
ran 1
until 1
we 1
were 1
completely 1
blown, 1
but 1
the 1
space 1
between 1
us 1
grew 1
ever 1
wider. 1
finally 1
we 1
stopped 1
and 1
sat 1
panting 1
on 1
two 1
rocks, 1
while 1
we 1
watched 1
him 1
disappearing 1
in 1
the 1
distance. 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
at 1
this 1
moment 1
that 1
there 1
occurred 1
a 1
most 1
strange 1
and 1
unexpected 1
thing. 1
we 1
had 1
risen 1
from 1
our 1
rocks 1
and 1
were 1
turning 1
to 1
go 1
home, 1
having 1
abandoned 1
the 1
hopeless 1
chase. 1
the 1
moon 1
was 1
low 1
upon 1
the 1
right, 1
and 1
the 1
jagged 1
pinnacle 1
of 1
a 1
granite 1
tor 1
stood 1
up 1
against 1
the 1
lower 1
curve 1
of 1
its 1
silver 1
disc. 1
there, 1
outlined 1
as 1
black 1
as 1
an 1
ebony 1
statue 1
on 1
that 1
shining 1
background, 1
i 1
saw 1
the 1
figure 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
upon 1
the 1
tor. 1
do 1
not 1
think 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
delusion, 1
holmes. 1
i 1
assure 1
you 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
never 1
in 1
my 1
life 1
seen 1
anything 1
more 1
clearly. 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
i 1
could 1
judge, 1
the 1
figure 1
was 1
that 1
of 1
a 1
tall, 1
thin 1
man. 1
he 1
stood 1
with 1
his 1
legs 1
a 1
little 1
separated, 1
his 1
arms 1
folded, 1
his 1
head 1
bowed, 1
as 1
if 1
he 1
were 1
brooding 1
over 1
that 1
enormous 1
wilderness 1
of 1
peat 1
and 1
granite 1
which 1
lay 1
before 1
him. 1
he 1
might 1
have 1
been 1
the 1
very 1
spirit 1
of 1
that 1
terrible 1
place. 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
the 1
convict. 1
this 1
man 1
was 1
far 1
from 1
the 1
place 1
where 1
the 1
latter 1
had 1
disappeared. 1
besides, 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
much 1
taller 1
man. 1
with 1
a 1
cry 1
of 1
surprise 1
i 1
pointed 1
him 1
out 1
to 1
the 1
baronet, 1
but 1
in 1
the 1
instant 1
during 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
turned 1
to 1
grasp 1
his 1
arm 1
the 1
man 1
was 1
gone. 1
there 1
was 1
the 1
sharp 1
pinnacle 1
of 1
granite 1
still 1
cutting 1
the 1
lower 1
edge 1
of 1
the 1
moon, 1
but 1
its 1
peak 1
bore 1
no 1
trace 1
of 1
that 1
silent 1
and 1
motionless 1
figure. 1
i 1
wished 1
to 1
go 1
in 1
that 1
direction 1
and 1
to 1
search 1
the 1
tor, 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
some 1
distance 1
away. 1
the 1
baronet’s 1
nerves 1
were 1
still 1
quivering 1
from 1
that 1
cry, 1
which 1
recalled 1
the 1
dark 1
story 1
of 1
his 1
family, 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
not 1
in 1
the 1
mood 1
for 1
fresh 1
adventures. 1
he 1
had 1
not 1
seen 1
this 1
lonely 1
man 1
upon 1
the 1
tor 1
and 1
could 1
not 1
feel 1
the 1
thrill 1
which 1
his 1
strange 1
presence 1
and 1
his 1
commanding 1
attitude 1
had 1
given 1
to 1
me. 1
“a 1
warder, 1
no 1
doubt,” 1
said 1
he. 1
“the 1
moor 1
has 1
been 1
thick 1
with 1
them 1
since 1
this 1
fellow 1
escaped.” 1
well, 1
perhaps 1
his 1
explanation 1
may 1
be 1
the 1
right 1
one, 1
but 1
i 1
should 1
like 1
to 1
have 1
some 1
further 1
proof 1
of 1
it. 1
today 1
we 1
mean 1
to 1
communicate 1
to 1
the 1
princetown 1
people 1
where 1
they 1
should 1
look 1
for 1
their 1
missing 1
man, 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
hard 1
lines 1
that 1
we 1
have 1
not 1
actually 1
had 1
the 1
triumph 1
of 1
bringing 1
him 1
back 1
as 1
our 1
own 1
prisoner. 1
such 1
are 1
the 1
adventures 1
of 1
last 1
night, 1
and 1
you 1
must 1
acknowledge, 1
my 1
dear 1
holmes, 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
done 1
you 1
very 1
well 1
in 1
the 1
matter 1
of 1
a 1
report. 1
much 1
of 1
what 1
i 1
tell 1
you 1
is 1
no 1
doubt 1
quite 1
irrelevant, 1
but 1
still 1
i 1
feel 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
best 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
let 1
you 1
have 1
all 1
the 1
facts 1
and 1
leave 1
you 1
to 1
select 1
for 1
yourself 1
those 1
which 1
will 1
be 1
of 1
most 1
service 1
to 1
you 1
in 1
helping 1
you 1
to 1
your 1
conclusions. 1
we 1
are 1
certainly 1
making 1
some 1
progress. 1
so 1
far 1
as 1
the 1
barrymores 1
go 1
we 1
have 1
found 1
the 1
motive 1
of 1
their 1
actions, 1
and 1
that 1
has 1
cleared 1
up 1
the 1
situation 1
very 1
much. 1
but 1
the 1
moor 1
with 1
its 1
mysteries 1
and 1
its 1
strange 1
inhabitants 1
remains 1
as 1
inscrutable 1
as 1
ever. 1
perhaps 1
in 1
my 1
next 1
i 1
may 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
throw 1
some 1
light 1
upon 1
this 1
also. 1
best 1
of 1
all 1
would 1
it 1
be 1
if 1
you 1
could 1
come 1
down 1
to 1
us. 1
in 1
any 1
case 1
you 1
will 1
hear 1
from 1
me 1
again 1
in 1
the 1
course 1
of 1
the 1
next 1
few 1
days. 1
chapter 1
10. 1
extract 1
from 1
the 1
diary 1
of 1
dr. 1
watson 1
so 1
far 1
i 1
have 1
been 1
able 1
to 1
quote 1
from 1
the 1
reports 1
which 1
i 1
have 1
forwarded 1
during 1
these 1
early 1
days 1
to 1
sherlock 1
holmes. 1
now, 1
however, 1
i 1
have 1
arrived 1
at 1
a 1
point 1
in 1
my 1
narrative 1
where 1
i 1
am 1
compelled 1
to 1
abandon 1
this 1
method 1
and 1
to 1
trust 1
once 1
more 1
to 1
my 1
recollections, 1
aided 1
by 1
the 1
diary 1
which 1
i 1
kept 1
at 1
the 1
time. 1
a 1
few 1
extracts 1
from 1
the 1
latter 1
will 1
carry 1
me 1
on 1
to 1
those 1
scenes 1
which 1
are 1
indelibly 1
fixed 1
in 1
every 1
detail 1
upon 1
my 1
memory. 1
i 1
proceed, 1
then, 1
from 1
the 1
morning 1
which 1
followed 1
our 1
abortive 1
chase 1
of 1
the 1
convict 1
and 1
our 1
other 1
strange 1
experiences 1
upon 1
the 1
moor. 1
_october_ 1
16_th_.—a 1
dull 1
and 1
foggy 1
day 1
with 1
a 1
drizzle 1
of 1
rain. 1
the 1
house 1
is 1
banked 1
in 1
with 1
rolling 1
clouds, 1
which 1
rise 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
to 1
show 1
the 1
dreary 1
curves 1
of 1
the 1
moor, 1
with 1
thin, 1
silver 1
veins 1
upon 1
the 1
sides 1
of 1
the 1
hills, 1
and 1
the 1
distant 1
boulders 1
gleaming 1
where 1
the 1
light 1
strikes 1
upon 1
their 1
wet 1
faces. 1
it 1
is 1
melancholy 1
outside 1
and 1
in. 1
the 1
baronet 1
is 1
in 1
a 1
black 1
reaction 1
after 1
the 1
excitements 1
of 1
the 1
night. 1
i 1
am 1
conscious 1
myself 1
of 1
a 1
weight 1
at 1
my 1
heart 1
and 1
a 1
feeling 1
of 1
impending 1
danger—ever 1
present 1
danger, 1
which 1
is 1
the 1
more 1
terrible 1
because 1
i 1
am 1
unable 1
to 1
define 1
it. 1
and 1
have 1
i 1
not 1
cause 1
for 1
such 1
a 1
feeling? 1
consider 1
the 1
long 1
sequence 1
of 1
incidents 1
which 1
have 1
all 1
pointed 1
to 1
some 1
sinister 1
influence 1
which 1
is 1
at 1
work 1
around 1
us. 1
there 1
is 1
the 1
death 1
of 1
the 1
last 1
occupant 1
of 1
the 1
hall, 1
fulfilling 1
so 1
exactly 1
the 1
conditions 1
of 1
the 1
family 1
legend, 1
and 1
there 1
are 1
the 1
repeated 1
reports 1
from 1
peasants 1
of 1
the 1
appearance 1
of 1
a 1
strange 1
creature 1
upon 1
the 1
moor. 1
twice 1
i 1
have 1
with 1
my 1
own 1
ears 1
heard 1
the 1
sound 1
which 1
resembled 1
the 1
distant 1
baying 1
of 1
a 1
hound. 1
it 1
is 1
incredible, 1
impossible, 1
that 1
it 1
should 1
really 1
be 1
outside 1
the 1
ordinary 1
laws 1
of 1
nature. 1
a 1
spectral 1
hound 1
which 1
leaves 1
material 1
footmarks 1
and 1
fills 1
the 1
air 1
with 1
its 1
howling 1
is 1
surely 1
not 1
to 1
be 1
thought 1
of. 1
stapleton 1
may 1
fall 1
in 1
with 1
such 1
a 1
superstition, 1
and 1
mortimer 1
also, 1
but 1
if 1
i 1
have 1
one 1
quality 1
upon 1
earth 1
it 1
is 1
common 1
sense, 1
and 1
nothing 1
will 1
persuade 1
me 1
to 1
believe 1
in 1
such 1
a 1
thing. 1
to 1
do 1
so 1
would 1
be 1
to 1
descend 1
to 1
the 1
level 1
of 1
these 1
poor 1
peasants, 1
who 1
are 1
not 1
content 1
with 1
a 1
mere 1
fiend 1
dog 1
but 1
must 1
needs 1
describe 1
him 1
with 1
hell-fire 1
shooting 1
from 1
his 1
mouth 1
and 1
eyes. 1
holmes 1
would 1
not 1
listen 1
to 1
such 1
fancies, 1
and 1
i 1
am 1
his 1
agent. 1
but 1
facts 1
are 1
facts, 1
and 1
i 1
have 1
twice 1
heard 1
this 1
crying 1
upon 1
the 1
moor. 1
suppose 1
that 1
there 1
were 1
really 1
some 1
huge 1
hound 1
loose 1
upon 1
it; 1
that 1
would 1
go 1
far 1
to 1
explain 1
everything. 1
but 1
where 1
could 1
such 1
a 1
hound 1
lie 1
concealed, 1
where 1
did 1
it 1
get 1
its 1
food, 1
where 1
did 1
it 1
come 1
from, 1
how 1
was 1
it 1
that 1
no 1
one 1
saw 1
it 1
by 1
day? 1
it 1
must 1
be 1
confessed 1
that 1
the 1
natural 1
explanation 1
offers 1
almost 1
as 1
many 1
difficulties 1
as 1
the 1
other. 1
and 1
always, 1
apart 1
from 1
the 1
hound, 1
there 1
is 1
the 1
fact 1
of 1
the 1
human 1
agency 1
in 1
london, 1
the 1
man 1
in 1
the 1
cab, 1
and 1
the 1
letter 1
which 1
warned 1
sir 1
henry 1
against 1
the 1
moor. 1
this 1
at 1
least 1
was 1
real, 1
but 1
it 1
might 1
have 1
been 1
the 1
work 1
of 1
a 1
protecting 1
friend 1
as 1
easily 1
as 1
of 1
an 1
enemy. 1
where 1
is 1
that 1
friend 1
or 1
enemy 1
now? 1
has 1
he 1
remained 1
in 1
london, 1
or 1
has 1
he 1
followed 1
us 1
down 1
here? 1
could 1
he—could 1
he 1
be 1
the 1
stranger 1
whom 1
i 1
saw 1
upon 1
the 1
tor? 1
it 1
is 1
true 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
had 1
only 1
the 1
one 1
glance 1
at 1
him, 1
and 1
yet 1
there 1
are 1
some 1
things 1
to 1
which 1
i 1
am 1
ready 1
to 1
swear. 1
he 1
is 1
no 1
one 1
whom 1
i 1
have 1
seen 1
down 1
here, 1
and 1
i 1
have 1
now 1
met 1
all 1
the 1
neighbours. 1
the 1
figure 1
was 1
far 1
taller 1
than 1
that 1
of 1
stapleton, 1
far 1
thinner 1
than 1
that 1
of 1
frankland. 1
barrymore 1
it 1
might 1
possibly 1
have 1
been, 1
but 1
we 1
had 1
left 1
him 1
behind 1
us, 1
and 1
i 1
am 1
certain 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
have 1
followed 1
us. 1
a 1
stranger 1
then 1
is 1
still 1
dogging 1
us, 1
just 1
as 1
a 1
stranger 1
dogged 1
us 1
in 1
london. 1
we 1
have 1
never 1
shaken 1
him 1
off. 1
if 1
i 1
could 1
lay 1
my 1
hands 1
upon 1
that 1
man, 1
then 1
at 1
last 1
we 1
might 1
find 1
ourselves 1
at 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
all 1
our 1
difficulties. 1
to 1
this 1
one 1
purpose 1
i 1
must 1
now 1
devote 1
all 1
my 1
energies. 1
my 1
first 1
impulse 1
was 1
to 1
tell 1
sir 1
henry 1
all 1
my 1
plans. 1
my 1
second 1
and 1
wisest 1
one 1
is 1
to 1
play 1
my 1
own 1
game 1
and 1
speak 1
as 1
little 1
as 1
possible 1
to 1
anyone. 1
he 1
is 1
silent 1
and 1
distrait. 1
his 1
nerves 1
have 1
been 1
strangely 1
shaken 1
by 1
that 1
sound 1
upon 1
the 1
moor. 1
i 1
will 1
say 1
nothing 1
to 1
add 1
to 1
his 1
anxieties, 1
but 1
i 1
will 1
take 1
my 1
own 1
steps 1
to 1
attain 1
my 1
own 1
end. 1
we 1
had 1
a 1
small 1
scene 1
this 1
morning 1
after 1
breakfast. 1
barrymore 1
asked 1
leave 1
to 1
speak 1
with 1
sir 1
henry, 1
and 1
they 1
were 1
closeted 1
in 1
his 1
study 1
some 1
little 1
time. 1
sitting 1
in 1
the 1
billiard-room 1
i 1
more 1
than 1
once 1
heard 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
voices 1
raised, 1
and 1
i 1
had 1
a 1
pretty 1
good 1
idea 1
what 1
the 1
point 1
was 1
which 1
was 1
under 1
discussion. 1
after 1
a 1
time 1
the 1
baronet 1
opened 1
his 1
door 1
and 1
called 1
for 1
me. 1
“barrymore 1
considers 1
that 1
he 1
has 1
a 1
grievance,” 1
he 1
said. 1
“he 1
thinks 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
unfair 1
on 1
our 1
part 1
to 1
hunt 1
his 1
brother-in-law 1
down 1
when 1
he, 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
free 1
will, 1
had 1
told 1
us 1
the 1
secret.” 1
the 1
butler 1
was 1
standing 1
very 1
pale 1
but 1
very 1
collected 1
before 1
us. 1
“i 1
may 1
have 1
spoken 1
too 1
warmly, 1
sir,” 1
said 1
he, 1
“and 1
if 1
i 1
have, 1
i 1
am 1
sure 1
that 1
i 1
beg 1
your 1
pardon. 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
time, 1
i 1
was 1
very 1
much 1
surprised 1
when 1
i 1
heard 1
you 1
two 1
gentlemen 1
come 1
back 1
this 1
morning 1
and 1
learned 1
that 1
you 1
had 1
been 1
chasing 1
selden. 1
the 1
poor 1
fellow 1
has 1
enough 1
to 1
fight 1
against 1
without 1
my 1
putting 1
more 1
upon 1
his 1
track.” 1
“if 1
you 1
had 1
told 1
us 1
of 1
your 1
own 1
free 1
will 1
it 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
a 1
different 1
thing,” 1
said 1
the 1
baronet, 1
“you 1
only 1
told 1
us, 1
or 1
rather 1
your 1
wife 1
only 1
told 1
us, 1
when 1
it 1
was 1
forced 1
from 1
you 1
and 1
you 1
could 1
not 1
help 1
yourself.” 1
“i 1
didn’t 1
think 1
you 1
would 1
have 1
taken 1
advantage 1
of 1
it, 1
sir 1
henry—indeed 1
i 1
didn’t.” 1
“the 1
man 1
is 1
a 1
public 1
danger. 1
there 1
are 1
lonely 1
houses 1
scattered 1
over 1
the 1
moor, 1
and 1
he 1
is 1
a 1
fellow 1
who 1
would 1
stick 1
at 1
nothing. 1
you 1
only 1
want 1
to 1
get 1
a 1
glimpse 1
of 1
his 1
face 1
to 1
see 1
that. 1
look 1
at 1
mr. 1
stapleton’s 1
house, 1
for 1
example, 1
with 1
no 1
one 1
but 1
himself 1
to 1
defend 1
it. 1
there’s 1
no 1
safety 1
for 1
anyone 1
until 1
he 1
is 1
under 1
lock 1
and 1
key.” 1
“he’ll 1
break 1
into 1
no 1
house, 1
sir. 1
i 1
give 1
you 1
my 1
solemn 1
word 1
upon 1
that. 1
but 1
he 1
will 1
never 1
trouble 1
anyone 1
in 1
this 1
country 1
again. 1
i 1
assure 1
you, 1
sir 1
henry, 1
that 1
in 1
a 1
very 1
few 1
days 1
the 1
necessary 1
arrangements 1
will 1
have 1
been 1
made 1
and 1
he 1
will 1
be 1
on 1
his 1
way 1
to 1
south 1
america. 1
for 1
god’s 1
sake, 1
sir, 1
i 1
beg 1
of 1
you 1
not 1
to 1
let 1
the 1
police 1
know 1
that 1
he 1
is 1
still 1
on 1
the 1
moor. 1
they 1
have 1
given 1
up 1
the 1
chase 1
there, 1
and 1
he 1
can 1
lie 1
quiet 1
until 1
the 1
ship 1
is 1
ready 1
for 1
him. 1
you 1
can’t 1
tell 1
on 1
him 1
without 1
getting 1
my 1
wife 1
and 1
me 1
into 1
trouble. 1
i 1
beg 1
you, 1
sir, 1
to 1
say 1
nothing 1
to 1
the 1
police.” 1
“what 1
do 1
you 1
say, 1
watson?” 1
i 1
shrugged 1
my 1
shoulders. 1
“if 1
he 1
were 1
safely 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
country 1
it 1
would 1
relieve 1
the 1
tax-payer 1
of 1
a 1
burden.” 1
“but 1
how 1
about 1
the 1
chance 1
of 1
his 1
holding 1
someone 1
up 1
before 1
he 1
goes?” 1
“he 1
would 1
not 1
do 1
anything 1
so 1
mad, 1
sir. 1
we 1
have 1
provided 1
him 1
with 1
all 1
that 1
he 1
can 1
want. 1
to 1
commit 1
a 1
crime 1
would 1
be 1
to 1
show 1
where 1
he 1
was 1
hiding.” 1
“that 1
is 1
true,” 1
said 1
sir 1
henry. 1
“well, 1
barrymore—” 1
“god 1
bless 1
you, 1
sir, 1
and 1
thank 1
you 1
from 1
my 1
heart! 1
it 1
would 1
have 1
killed 1
my 1
poor 1
wife 1
had 1
he 1
been 1
taken 1
again.” 1
“i 1
guess 1
we 1
are 1
aiding 1
and 1
abetting 1
a 1
felony, 1
watson? 1
but, 1
after 1
what 1
we 1
have 1
heard 1
i 1
don’t 1
feel 1
as 1
if 1
i 1
could 1
give 1
the 1
man 1
up, 1
so 1
there 1
is 1
an 1
end 1
of 1
it. 1
all 1
right, 1
barrymore, 1
you 1
can 1
go.” 1
with 1
a 1
few 1
broken 1
words 1
of 1
gratitude 1
the 1
man 1
turned, 1
but 1
he 1
hesitated 1
and 1
then 1
came 1
back. 1
“you’ve 1
been 1
so 1
kind 1
to 1
us, 1
sir, 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
like 1
to 1
do 1
the 1
best 1
i 1
can 1
for 1
you 1
in 1
return. 1
i 1
know 1
something, 1
sir 1
henry, 1
and 1
perhaps 1
i 1
should 1
have 1
said 1
it 1
before, 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
long 1
after 1
the 1
inquest 1
that 1
i 1
found 1
it 1
out. 1
i’ve 1
never 1
breathed 1
a 1
word 1
about 1
it 1
yet 1
to 1
mortal 1
man. 1
it’s 1
about 1
poor 1
sir 1
charles’s 1
death.” 1
the 1
baronet 1
and 1
i 1
were 1
both 1
upon 1
our 1
feet. 1
“do 1
you 1
know 1
how 1
he 1
died?” 1
“no, 1
sir, 1
i 1
don’t 1
know 1
that.” 1
“what 1
then?” 1
“i 1
know 1
why 1
he 1
was 1
at 1
the 1
gate 1
at 1
that 1
hour. 1
it 1
was 1
to 1
meet 1
a 1
woman.” 1
“to 1
meet 1
a 1
woman! 1
he?” 1
“yes, 1
sir.” 1
“and 1
the 1
woman’s 1
name?” 1
“i 1
can’t 1
give 1
you 1
the 1
name, 1
sir, 1
but 1
i 1
can 1
give 1
you 1
the 1
initials. 1
her 1
initials 1
were 1
l. 1
l.” 1
“how 1
do 1
you 1
know 1
this, 1
barrymore?” 1
“well, 1
sir 1
henry, 1
your 1
uncle 1
had 1
a 1
letter 1
that 1
morning. 1
he 1
had 1
usually 1
a 1
great 1
many 1
letters, 1
for 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
public 1
man 1
and 1
well 1
known 1
for 1
his 1
kind 1
heart, 1
so 1
that 1
everyone 1
who 1
was 1
in 1
trouble 1
was 1
glad 1
to 1
turn 1
to 1
him. 1
but 1
that 1
morning, 1
as 1
it 1
chanced, 1
there 1
was 1
only 1
this 1
one 1
letter, 1
so 1
i 1
took 1
the 1
more 1
notice 1
of 1
it. 1
it 1
was 1
from 1
coombe 1
tracey, 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
addressed 1
in 1
a 1
woman’s 1
hand.” 1
“well?” 1
“well, 1
sir, 1
i 1
thought 1
no 1
more 1
of 1
the 1
matter, 1
and 1
never 1
would 1
have 1
done 1
had 1
it 1
not 1
been 1
for 1
my 1
wife. 1
only 1
a 1
few 1
weeks 1
ago 1
she 1
was 1
cleaning 1
out 1
sir 1
charles’s 1
study—it 1
had 1
never 1
been 1
touched 1
since 1
his 1
death—and 1
she 1
found 1
the 1
ashes 1
of 1
a 1
burned 1
letter 1
in 1
the 1
back 1
of 1
the 1
grate. 1
the 1
greater 1
part 1
of 1
it 1
was 1
charred 1
to 1
pieces, 1
but 1
one 1
little 1
slip, 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
a 1
page, 1
hung 1
together, 1
and 1
the 1
writing 1
could 1
still 1
be 1
read, 1
though 1
it 1
was 1
grey 1
on 1
a 1
black 1
ground. 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
us 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
postscript 1
at 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
letter 1
and 1
it 1
said: 1
‘please, 1
please, 1
as 1
you 1
are 1
a 1
gentleman, 1
burn 1
this 1
letter, 1
and 1
be 1
at 1
the 1
gate 1
by 1
ten 1
o 1
clock. 1
beneath 1
it 1
were 1
signed 1
the 1
initials 1
l. 1
l.” 1
“have 1
you 1
got 1
that 1
slip?” 1
“no, 1
sir, 1
it 1
crumbled 1
all 1
to 1
bits 1
after 1
we 1
moved 1
it.” 1
“had 1
sir 1
charles 1
received 1
any 1
other 1
letters 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
writing?” 1
“well, 1
sir, 1
i 1
took 1
no 1
particular 1
notice 1
of 1
his 1
letters. 1
i 1
should 1
not 1
have 1
noticed 1
this 1
one, 1
only 1
it 1
happened 1
to 1
come 1
alone.” 1
“and 1
you 1
have 1
no 1
idea 1
who 1
l. 1
l. 1
is?” 1
“no, 1
sir. 1
no 1
more 1
than 1
you 1
have. 1
but 1
i 1
expect 1
if 1
we 1
could 1
lay 1
our 1
hands 1
upon 1
that 1
lady 1
we 1
should 1
know 1
more 1
about 1
sir 1
charles’s 1
death.” 1
“i 1
cannot 1
understand, 1
barrymore, 1
how 1
you 1
came 1
to 1
conceal 1
this 1
important 1
information.” 1
“well, 1
sir, 1
it 1
was 1
immediately 1
after 1
that 1
our 1
own 1
trouble 1
came 1
to 1
us. 1
and 1
then 1
again, 1
sir, 1
we 1
were 1
both 1
of 1
us 1
very 1
fond 1
of 1
sir 1
charles, 1
as 1
we 1
well 1
might 1
be 1
considering 1
all 1
that 1
he 1
has 1
done 1
for 1
us. 1
to 1
rake 1
this 1
up 1
couldn’t 1
help 1
our 1
poor 1
master, 1
and 1
it’s 1
well 1
to 1
go 1
carefully 1
when 1
there’s 1
a 1
lady 1
in 1
the 1
case. 1
even 1
the 1
best 1
of 1
us—” 1
“you 1
thought 1
it 1
might 1
injure 1
his 1
reputation?” 1
“well, 1
sir, 1
i 1
thought 1
no 1
good 1
could 1
come 1
of 1
it. 1
but 1
now 1
you 1
have 1
been 1
kind 1
to 1
us, 1
and 1
i 1
feel 1
as 1
if 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
treating 1
you 1
unfairly 1
not 1
to 1
tell 1
you 1
all 1
that 1
i 1
know 1
about 1
the 1
matter.” 1
“very 1
good, 1
barrymore; 1
you 1
can 1
go.” 1
when 1
the 1
butler 1
had 1
left 1
us 1
sir 1
henry 1
turned 1
to 1
me. 1
“well, 1
watson, 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
of 1
this 1
new 1
light?” 1
“it 1
seems 1
to 1
leave 1
the 1
darkness 1
rather 1
blacker 1
than 1
before.” 1
“so 1
i 1
think. 1
but 1
if 1
we 1
can 1
only 1
trace 1
l. 1
l. 1
it 1
should 1
clear 1
up 1
the 1
whole 1
business. 1
we 1
have 1
gained 1
that 1
much. 1
we 1
know 1
that 1
there 1
is 1
someone 1
who 1
has 1
the 1
facts 1
if 1
we 1
can 1
only 1
find 1
her. 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
we 1
should 1
do?” 1
“let 1
holmes 1
know 1
all 1
about 1
it 1
at 1
once. 1
it 1
will 1
give 1
him 1
the 1
clue 1
for 1
which 1
he 1
has 1
been 1
seeking. 1
i 1
am 1
much 1
mistaken 1
if 1
it 1
does 1
not 1
bring 1
him 1
down.” 1
i 1
went 1
at 1
once 1
to 1
my 1
room 1
and 1
drew 1
up 1
my 1
report 1
of 1
the 1
morning’s 1
conversation 1
for 1
holmes. 1
it 1
was 1
evident 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
very 1
busy 1
of 1
late, 1
for 1
the 1
notes 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
from 1
baker 1
street 1
were 1
few 1
and 1
short, 1
with 1
no 1
comments 1
upon 1
the 1
information 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
supplied 1
and 1
hardly 1
any 1
reference 1
to 1
my 1
mission. 1
no 1
doubt 1
his 1
blackmailing 1
case 1
is 1
absorbing 1
all 1
his 1
faculties. 1
and 1
yet 1
this 1
new 1
factor 1
must 1
surely 1
arrest 1
his 1
attention 1
and 1
renew 1
his 1
interest. 1
i 1
wish 1
that 1
he 1
were 1
here. 1
_october_ 1
17_th_.—all 1
day 1
today 1
the 1
rain 1
poured 1
down, 1
rustling 1
on 1
the 1
ivy 1
and 1
dripping 1
from 1
the 1
eaves. 1
i 1
thought 1
of 1
the 1
convict 1
out 1
upon 1
the 1
bleak, 1
cold, 1
shelterless 1
moor. 1
poor 1
devil! 1
whatever 1
his 1
crimes, 1
he 1
has 1
suffered 1
something 1
to 1
atone 1
for 1
them. 1
and 1
then 1
i 1
thought 1
of 1
that 1
other 1
one—the 1
face 1
in 1
the 1
cab, 1
the 1
figure 1
against 1
the 1
moon. 1
was 1
he 1
also 1
out 1
in 1
that 1
deluged—the 1
unseen 1
watcher, 1
the 1
man 1
of 1
darkness? 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
i 1
put 1
on 1
my 1
waterproof 1
and 1
i 1
walked 1
far 1
upon 1
the 1
sodden 1
moor, 1
full 1
of 1
dark 1
imaginings, 1
the 1
rain 1
beating 1
upon 1
my 1
face 1
and 1
the 1
wind 1
whistling 1
about 1
my 1
ears. 1
