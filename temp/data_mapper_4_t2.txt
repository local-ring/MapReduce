chapter 1
1. 1
mr. 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
mr. 1
sherlock 1
holmes, 1
who 1
was 1
usually 1
very 1
late 1
in 1
the 1
mornings, 1
save 1
upon 1
those 1
not 1
infrequent 1
occasions 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
up 1
all 1
night, 1
was 1
seated 1
at 1
the 1
breakfast 1
table. 1
i 1
stood 1
upon 1
the 1
hearth-rug 1
and 1
picked 1
up 1
the 1
stick 1
which 1
our 1
visitor 1
had 1
left 1
behind 1
him 1
the 1
night 1
before. 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
fine, 1
thick 1
piece 1
of 1
wood, 1
bulbous-headed, 1
of 1
the 1
sort 1
which 1
is 1
known 1
as 1
a 1
“penang 1
lawyer.” 1
just 1
under 1
the 1
head 1
was 1
a 1
broad 1
silver 1
band 1
nearly 1
an 1
inch 1
across. 1
“to 1
james 1
mortimer, 1
m.r.c.s., 1
from 1
his 1
friends 1
of 1
the 1
c.c.h.,” 1
was 1
engraved 1
upon 1
it, 1
with 1
the 1
date 1
“1884.” 1
it 1
was 1
just 1
such 1
a 1
stick 1
as 1
the 1
old-fashioned 1
family 1
practitioner 1
used 1
to 1
carry—dignified, 1
solid, 1
and 1
reassuring. 1
“well, 1
watson, 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
make 1
of 1
it?” 1
holmes 1
was 1
sitting 1
with 1
his 1
back 1
to 1
me, 1
and 1
i 1
had 1
given 1
him 1
no 1
sign 1
of 1
my 1
occupation. 1
“how 1
did 1
you 1
know 1
what 1
i 1
was 1
doing? 1
i 1
believe 1
you 1
have 1
eyes 1
in 1
the 1
back 1
of 1
your 1
head.” 1
“i 1
have, 1
at 1
least, 1
a 1
well-polished, 1
silver-plated 1
coffee-pot 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
me,” 1
said 1
he. 1
“but, 1
tell 1
me, 1
watson, 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
make 1
of 1
our 1
visitor’s 1
stick? 1
since 1
we 1
have 1
been 1
so 1
unfortunate 1
as 1
to 1
miss 1
him 1
and 1
have 1
no 1
notion 1
of 1
his 1
errand, 1
this 1
accidental 1
souvenir 1
becomes 1
of 1
importance. 1
let 1
me 1
hear 1
you 1
reconstruct 1
the 1
man 1
by 1
an 1
examination 1
of 1
it.” 1
“i 1
think,” 1
said 1
i, 1
following 1
as 1
far 1
as 1
i 1
could 1
the 1
methods 1
of 1
my 1
companion, 1
“that 1
dr. 1
mortimer 1
is 1
a 1
successful, 1
elderly 1
medical 1
man, 1
well-esteemed 1
since 1
those 1
who 1
know 1
him 1
give 1
him 1
this 1
mark 1
of 1
their 1
appreciation.” 1
“good!” 1
said 1
holmes. 1
“excellent!” 1
“i 1
think 1
also 1
that 1
the 1
probability 1
is 1
in 1
favour 1
of 1
his 1
being 1
a 1
country 1
practitioner 1
who 1
does 1
a 1
great 1
deal 1
of 1
his 1
visiting 1
on 1
foot.” 1
“why 1
so?” 1
“because 1
this 1
stick, 1
though 1
originally 1
a 1
very 1
handsome 1
one 1
has 1
been 1
so 1
knocked 1
about 1
that 1
i 1
can 1
hardly 1
imagine 1
a 1
town 1
practitioner 1
carrying 1
it. 1
the 1
thick-iron 1
ferrule 1
is 1
worn 1
down, 1
so 1
it 1
is 1
evident 1
that 1
he 1
has 1
done 1
a 1
great 1
amount 1
of 1
walking 1
with 1
it.” 1
“perfectly 1
sound!” 1
said 1
holmes. 1
“and 1
then 1
again, 1
there 1
is 1
the 1
‘friends 1
of 1
the 1
c.c.h.’ 1
i 1
should 1
guess 1
that 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
something 1
hunt, 1
the 1
local 1
hunt 1
to 1
whose 1
members 1
he 1
has 1
possibly 1
given 1
some 1
surgical 1
assistance, 1
and 1
which 1
has 1
made 1
him 1
a 1
small 1
presentation 1
in 1
return.” 1
“really, 1
watson, 1
you 1
excel 1
yourself,” 1
said 1
holmes, 1
pushing 1
back 1
his 1
chair 1
and 1
lighting 1
a 1
cigarette. 1
“i 1
am 1
bound 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
in 1
all 1
the 1
accounts 1
which 1
you 1
have 1
been 1
so 1
good 1
as 1
to 1
give 1
of 1
my 1
own 1
small 1
achievements 1
you 1
have 1
habitually 1
underrated 1
your 1
own 1
abilities. 1
it 1
may 1
be 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
not 1
yourself 1
luminous, 1
but 1
you 1
are 1
a 1
conductor 1
of 1
light. 1
some 1
people 1
without 1
possessing 1
genius 1
have 1
a 1
remarkable 1
power 1
of 1
stimulating 1
it. 1
i 1
confess, 1
my 1
dear 1
fellow, 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
very 1
much 1
in 1
your 1
debt.” 1
he 1
had 1
never 1
said 1
as 1
much 1
before, 1
and 1
i 1
must 1
admit 1
that 1
his 1
words 1
gave 1
me 1
keen 1
pleasure, 1
for 1
i 1
had 1
often 1
been 1
piqued 1
by 1
his 1
indifference 1
to 1
my 1
admiration 1
and 1
to 1
the 1
attempts 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
made 1
to 1
give 1
publicity 1
to 1
his 1
methods. 1
i 1
was 1
proud, 1
too, 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
so 1
far 1
mastered 1
his 1
system 1
as 1
to 1
apply 1
it 1
in 1
a 1
way 1
which 1
earned 1
his 1
approval. 1
he 1
now 1
took 1
the 1
stick 1
from 1
my 1
hands 1
and 1
examined 1
it 1
for 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
with 1
his 1
naked 1
eyes. 1
then 1
with 1
an 1
expression 1
of 1
interest 1
he 1
laid 1
down 1
his 1
cigarette, 1
and 1
carrying 1
the 1
cane 1
to 1
the 1
window, 1
he 1
looked 1
over 1
it 1
again 1
with 1
a 1
convex 1
lens. 1
“interesting, 1
though 1
elementary,” 1
said 1
he 1
as 1
he 1
returned 1
to 1
his 1
favourite 1
corner 1
of 1
the 1
settee. 1
“there 1
are 1
certainly 1
one 1
or 1
two 1
indications 1
upon 1
the 1
stick. 1
it 1
gives 1
us 1
the 1
basis 1
for 1
several 1
deductions.” 1
“has 1
anything 1
escaped 1
me?” 1
i 1
asked 1
with 1
some 1
self-importance. 1
“i 1
trust 1
that 1
there 1
is 1
nothing 1
of 1
consequence 1
which 1
i 1
have 1
overlooked?” 1
“i 1
am 1
afraid, 1
my 1
dear 1
watson, 1
that 1
most 1
of 1
your 1
conclusions 1
were 1
erroneous. 1
when 1
i 1
said 1
that 1
you 1
stimulated 1
me 1
i 1
meant, 1
to 1
be 1
frank, 1
that 1
in 1
noting 1
your 1
fallacies 1
i 1
was 1
occasionally 1
guided 1
towards 1
the 1
truth. 1
not 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
entirely 1
wrong 1
in 1
this 1
instance. 1
the 1
man 1
is 1
certainly 1
a 1
country 1
practitioner. 1
and 1
he 1
walks 1
a 1
good 1
deal.” 1
“then 1
i 1
was 1
right.” 1
“to 1
that 1
extent.” 1
“but 1
that 1
was 1
all.” 1
“no, 1
no, 1
my 1
dear 1
watson, 1
not 1
all—by 1
no 1
means 1
all. 1
i 1
would 1
suggest, 1
for 1
example, 1
that 1
a 1
presentation 1
to 1
a 1
doctor 1
is 1
more 1
likely 1
to 1
come 1
from 1
a 1
hospital 1
than 1
from 1
a 1
hunt, 1
and 1
that 1
when 1
the 1
initials 1
‘c.c.’ 1
are 1
placed 1
before 1
that 1
hospital 1
the 1
words 1
‘charing 1
cross’ 1
very 1
naturally 1
suggest 1
themselves.” 1
“you 1
may 1
be 1
right.” 1
“the 1
probability 1
lies 1
in 1
that 1
direction. 1
and 1
if 1
we 1
take 1
this 1
as 1
a 1
working 1
hypothesis 1
we 1
have 1
a 1
fresh 1
basis 1
from 1
which 1
to 1
start 1
our 1
construction 1
of 1
this 1
unknown 1
visitor.” 1
“well, 1
then, 1
supposing 1
that 1
‘c.c.h.’ 1
does 1
stand 1
for 1
‘charing 1
cross 1
hospital,’ 1
what 1
further 1
inferences 1
may 1
we 1
draw?” 1
“do 1
none 1
suggest 1
themselves? 1
you 1
know 1
my 1
methods. 1
apply 1
them!” 1
“i 1
can 1
only 1
think 1
of 1
the 1
obvious 1
conclusion 1
that 1
the 1
man 1
has 1
practised 1
in 1
town 1
before 1
going 1
to 1
the 1
country.” 1
“i 1
think 1
that 1
we 1
might 1
venture 1
a 1
little 1
farther 1
than 1
this. 1
look 1
at 1
it 1
in 1
this 1
light. 1
on 1
what 1
occasion 1
would 1
it 1
be 1
most 1
probable 1
that 1
such 1
a 1
presentation 1
would 1
be 1
made? 1
when 1
would 1
his 1
friends 1
unite 1
to 1
give 1
him 1
a 1
pledge 1
of 1
their 1
good 1
will? 1
obviously 1
at 1
the 1
moment 1
when 1
dr. 1
mortimer 1
withdrew 1
from 1
the 1
service 1
of 1
the 1
hospital 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
start 1
a 1
practice 1
for 1
himself. 1
we 1
know 1
there 1
has 1
been 1
a 1
presentation. 1
we 1
believe 1
there 1
has 1
been 1
a 1
change 1
from 1
a 1
town 1
hospital 1
to 1
a 1
country 1
practice. 1
is 1
it, 1
then, 1
stretching 1
our 1
inference 1
too 1
far 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
the 1
presentation 1
was 1
on 1
the 1
occasion 1
of 1
the 1
change?” 1
“it 1
certainly 1
seems 1
probable.” 1
“now, 1
you 1
will 1
observe 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
have 1
been 1
on 1
the 1
_staff_ 1
of 1
the 1
hospital, 1
since 1
only 1
a 1
man 1
well-established 1
in 1
a 1
london 1
practice 1
could 1
hold 1
such 1
a 1
position, 1
and 1
such 1
a 1
one 1
would 1
not 1
drift 1
into 1
the 1
country. 1
what 1
was 1
he, 1
then? 1
if 1
he 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
hospital 1
and 1
yet 1
not 1
on 1
the 1
staff 1
he 1
could 1
only 1
have 1
been 1
a 1
house-surgeon 1
or 1
a 1
house-physician—little 1
more 1
than 1
a 1
senior 1
student. 1
and 1
he 1
left 1
five 1
years 1
ago—the 1
date 1
is 1
on 1
the 1
stick. 1
so 1
your 1
grave, 1
middle-aged 1
family 1
practitioner 1
vanishes 1
into 1
thin 1
air, 1
my 1
dear 1
watson, 1
and 1
there 1
emerges 1
a 1
young 1
fellow 1
under 1
thirty, 1
amiable, 1
unambitious, 1
absent-minded, 1
and 1
the 1
possessor 1
of 1
a 1
favourite 1
dog, 1
which 1
i 1
should 1
describe 1
roughly 1
as 1
being 1
larger 1
than 1
a 1
terrier 1
and 1
smaller 1
than 1
a 1
mastiff.” 1
i 1
laughed 1
incredulously 1
as 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
leaned 1
back 1
in 1
his 1
settee 1
and 1
blew 1
little 1
wavering 1
rings 1
of 1
smoke 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
ceiling. 1
“as 1
to 1
the 1
latter 1
part, 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
means 1
of 1
checking 1
you,” 1
said 1
i, 1
“but 1
at 1
least 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
difficult 1
to 1
find 1
out 1
a 1
few 1
particulars 1
about 1
the 1
man’s 1
age 1
and 1
professional 1
career.” 1
from 1
my 1
small 1
medical 1
shelf 1
i 1
took 1
down 1
the 1
medical 1
directory 1
and 1
turned 1
up 1
the 1
name. 1
there 1
were 1
several 1
mortimers, 1
but 1
only 1
one 1
who 1
could 1
be 1
our 1
visitor. 1
i 1
read 1
his 1
record 1
aloud. 1
“mortimer, 1
james, 1
m.r.c.s., 1
1882, 1
grimpen, 1
dartmoor, 1
devon. 1
house-surgeon, 1
from 1
1882 1
to 1
1884, 1
at 1
charing 1
cross 1
hospital. 1
winner 1
of 1
the 1
jackson 1
prize 1
for 1
comparative 1
pathology, 1
with 1
essay 1
entitled 1
‘is 1
disease 1
a 1
reversion?’ 1
corresponding 1
member 1
of 1
the 1
swedish 1
pathological 1
society. 1
author 1
of 1
‘some 1
freaks 1
of 1
atavism’ 1
(_lancet_ 1
1882). 1
‘do 1
we 1
progress?’ 1
(_journal 1
of 1
psychology_, 1
march, 1
1883). 1
medical 1
officer 1
for 1
the 1
parishes 1
of 1
grimpen, 1
thorsley, 1
and 1
high 1
barrow.” 1
“no 1
mention 1
of 1
that 1
local 1
hunt, 1
watson,” 1
said 1
holmes 1
with 1
a 1
mischievous 1
smile, 1
“but 1
a 1
country 1
doctor, 1
as 1
you 1
very 1
astutely 1
observed. 1
i 1
think 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
fairly 1
justified 1
in 1
my 1
inferences. 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
adjectives, 1
i 1
said, 1
if 1
i 1
remember 1
right, 1
amiable, 1
unambitious, 1
and 1
absent-minded. 1
it 1
is 1
my 1
experience 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
only 1
an 1
amiable 1
man 1
in 1
this 1
world 1
who 1
receives 1
testimonials, 1
only 1
an 1
unambitious 1
one 1
who 1
abandons 1
a 1
london 1
career 1
for 1
the 1
country, 1
and 1
only 1
an 1
absent-minded 1
one 1
who 1
leaves 1
his 1
stick 1
and 1
not 1
his 1
visiting-card 1
after 1
waiting 1
an 1
hour 1
in 1
your 1
room.” 1
“and 1
the 1
dog?” 1
“has 1
been 1
in 1
the 1
habit 1
of 1
carrying 1
this 1
stick 1
behind 1
his 1
master. 1
being 1
a 1
heavy 1
stick 1
the 1
dog 1
has 1
held 1
it 1
tightly 1
by 1
the 1
middle, 1
and 1
the 1
marks 1
of 1
his 1
teeth 1
are 1
very 1
plainly 1
visible. 1
the 1
dog’s 1
jaw, 1
as 1
shown 1
in 1
the 1
space 1
between 1
these 1
marks, 1
is 1
too 1
broad 1
in 1
my 1
opinion 1
for 1
a 1
terrier 1
and 1
not 1
broad 1
enough 1
for 1
a 1
mastiff. 1
it 1
may 1
have 1
been—yes, 1
by 1
jove, 1
it 1
_is_ 1
a 1
curly-haired 1
spaniel.” 1
he 1
had 1
risen 1
and 1
paced 1
the 1
room 1
as 1
he 1
spoke. 1
now 1
he 1
halted 1
in 1
the 1
recess 1
of 1
the 1
window. 1
there 1
was 1
such 1
a 1
ring 1
of 1
conviction 1
in 1
his 1
voice 1
that 1
i 1
glanced 1
up 1
in 1
surprise. 1
“my 1
dear 1
fellow, 1
how 1
can 1
you 1
possibly 1
be 1
so 1
sure 1
of 1
that?” 1
“for 1
the 1
very 1
simple 1
reason 1
that 1
i 1
see 1
the 1
dog 1
himself 1
on 1
our 1
very 1
door-step, 1
and 1
there 1
is 1
the 1
ring 1
of 1
its 1
owner. 1
don’t 1
move, 1
i 1
beg 1
you, 1
watson. 1
he 1
is 1
a 1
professional 1
brother 1
of 1
yours, 1
and 1
your 1
presence 1
may 1
be 1
of 1
assistance 1
to 1
me. 1
now 1
is 1
the 1
dramatic 1
moment 1
of 1
fate, 1
watson, 1
when 1
you 1
hear 1
a 1
step 1
upon 1
the 1
stair 1
which 1
is 1
walking 1
into 1
your 1
life, 1
and 1
you 1
know 1
not 1
whether 1
for 1
good 1
or 1
ill. 1
what 1
does 1
dr. 1
james 1
mortimer, 1
the 1
man 1
of 1
science, 1
ask 1
of 1
sherlock 1
holmes, 1
the 1
specialist 1
in 1
crime? 1
come 1
in!” 1
the 1
appearance 1
of 1
our 1
visitor 1
was 1
a 1
surprise 1
to 1
me, 1
since 1
i 1
had 1
expected 1
a 1
typical 1
country 1
practitioner. 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
very 1
tall, 1
thin 1
man, 1
with 1
a 1
long 1
nose 1
like 1
a 1
beak, 1
which 1
jutted 1
out 1
between 1
two 1
keen, 1
grey 1
eyes, 1
set 1
closely 1
together 1
and 1
sparkling 1
brightly 1
from 1
behind 1
a 1
pair 1
of 1
gold-rimmed 1
glasses. 1
he 1
was 1
clad 1
in 1
a 1
professional 1
but 1
rather 1
slovenly 1
fashion, 1
for 1
his 1
frock-coat 1
was 1
dingy 1
and 1
his 1
trousers 1
frayed. 1
though 1
young, 1
his 1
long 1
back 1
was 1
already 1
bowed, 1
and 1
he 1
walked 1
with 1
a 1
forward 1
thrust 1
of 1
his 1
head 1
and 1
a 1
general 1
air 1
of 1
peering 1
benevolence. 1
as 1
he 1
entered 1
his 1
eyes 1
fell 1
upon 1
the 1
stick 1
in 1
holmes’s 1
hand, 1
and 1
he 1
ran 1
towards 1
it 1
with 1
an 1
exclamation 1
of 1
joy. 1
“i 1
am 1
so 1
very 1
glad,” 1
said 1
he. 1
“i 1
was 1
not 1
sure 1
whether 1
i 1
had 1
left 1
it 1
here 1
or 1
in 1
the 1
shipping 1
office. 1
i 1
would 1
not 1
lose 1
that 1
stick 1
for 1
the 1
world.” 1
“a 1
presentation, 1
i 1
see,” 1
said 1
holmes. 1
“yes, 1
sir.” 1
“from 1
charing 1
cross 1
hospital?” 1
“from 1
one 1
or 1
two 1
friends 1
there 1
on 1
the 1
occasion 1
of 1
my 1
marriage.” 1
“dear, 1
dear, 1
that’s 1
bad!” 1
said 1
holmes, 1
shaking 1
his 1
head. 1
dr. 1
mortimer 1
blinked 1
through 1
his 1
glasses 1
in 1
mild 1
astonishment. 1
“why 1
was 1
it 1
bad?” 1
“only 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
disarranged 1
our 1
little 1
deductions. 1
your 1
marriage, 1
you 1
say?” 1
“yes, 1
sir. 1
i 1
married, 1
and 1
so 1
left 1
the 1
hospital, 1
and 1
with 1
it 1
all 1
hopes 1
of 1
a 1
consulting 1
practice. 1
it 1
was 1
necessary 1
to 1
make 1
a 1
home 1
of 1
my 1
own.” 1
“come, 1
come, 1
we 1
are 1
not 1
so 1
far 1
wrong, 1
after 1
all,” 1
said 1
holmes. 1
“and 1
now, 1
dr. 1
james 1
mortimer—” 1
“mister, 1
sir, 1
mister—a 1
humble 1
m.r.c.s.” 1
“and 1
a 1
man 1
of 1
precise 1
mind, 1
evidently.” 1
“a 1
dabbler 1
in 1
science, 1
mr. 1
holmes, 1
a 1
picker 1
up 1
of 1
shells 1
on 1
the 1
shores 1
of 1
the 1
great 1
unknown 1
ocean. 1
i 1
presume 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
mr. 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
whom 1
i 1
am 1
addressing 1
and 1
not—” 1
“no, 1
this 1
is 1
my 1
friend 1
dr. 1
watson.” 1
“glad 1
to 1
meet 1
you, 1
sir. 1
i 1
have 1
heard 1
your 1
name 1
mentioned 1
in 1
connection 1
with 1
that 1
of 1
your 1
friend. 1
you 1
interest 1
me 1
very 1
much, 1
mr. 1
holmes. 1
i 1
had 1
hardly 1
expected 1
so 1
dolichocephalic 1
a 1
skull 1
or 1
such 1
well-marked 1
supra-orbital 1
development. 1
would 1
you 1
have 1
any 1
objection 1
to 1
my 1
running 1
my 1
finger 1
along 1
your 1
parietal 1
fissure? 1
a 1
cast 1
of 1
your 1
skull, 1
sir, 1
until 1
the 1
original 1
is 1
available, 1
would 1
be 1
an 1
ornament 1
to 1
any 1
anthropological 1
museum. 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
my 1
intention 1
to 1
be 1
fulsome, 1
but 1
i 1
confess 1
that 1
i 1
covet 1
your 1
skull.” 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
waved 1
our 1
strange 1
visitor 1
into 1
a 1
chair. 1
“you 1
are 1
an 1
enthusiast 1
in 1
your 1
line 1
of 1
thought, 1
i 1
perceive, 1
sir, 1
as 1
i 1
am 1
in 1
mine,” 1
said 1
he. 1
“i 1
observe 1
from 1
your 1
forefinger 1
that 1
you 1
make 1
your 1
own 1
cigarettes. 1
have 1
no 1
hesitation 1
in 1
lighting 1
one.” 1
the 1
man 1
drew 1
out 1
paper 1
and 1
tobacco 1
and 1
twirled 1
the 1
one 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
other 1
with 1
surprising 1
dexterity. 1
he 1
had 1
long, 1
quivering 1
fingers 1
as 1
agile 1
and 1
restless 1
as 1
the 1
antennæ 1
of 1
an 1
insect. 1
holmes 1
was 1
silent, 1
but 1
his 1
little 1
darting 1
glances 1
showed 1
me 1
the 1
interest 1
which 1
he 1
took 1
in 1
our 1
curious 1
companion. 1
“i 1
presume, 1
sir,” 1
said 1
he 1
at 1
last, 1
“that 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
merely 1
for 1
the 1
purpose 1
of 1
examining 1
my 1
skull 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
done 1
me 1
the 1
honour 1
to 1
call 1
here 1
last 1
night 1
and 1
again 1
today?” 1
“no, 1
sir, 1
no; 1
though 1
i 1
am 1
happy 1
to 1
have 1
had 1
the 1
opportunity 1
of 1
doing 1
that 1
as 1
well. 1
i 1
came 1
to 1
you, 1
mr. 1
holmes, 1
because 1
i 1
recognized 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
myself 1
an 1
unpractical 1
man 1
and 1
because 1
i 1
am 1
suddenly 1
confronted 1
with 1
a 1
most 1
serious 1
and 1
extraordinary 1
problem. 1
recognizing, 1
as 1
i 1
do, 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
the 1
second 1
highest 1
expert 1
in 1
europe—” 1
“indeed, 1
sir! 1
may 1
i 1
inquire 1
who 1
has 1
the 1
honour 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
first?” 1
asked 1
holmes 1
with 1
some 1
asperity. 1
“to 1
the 1
man 1
of 1
precisely 1
scientific 1
mind 1
the 1
work 1
of 1
monsieur 1
bertillon 1
must 1
always 1
appeal 1
strongly.” 1
“then 1
had 1
you 1
not 1
better 1
consult 1
him?” 1
“i 1
said, 1
sir, 1
to 1
the 1
precisely 1
scientific 1
mind. 1
but 1
as 1
a 1
practical 1
man 1
of 1
affairs 1
it 1
is 1
acknowledged 1
that 1
you 1
stand 1
alone. 1
i 1
trust, 1
sir, 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
not 1
inadvertently—” 1
“just 1
a 1
little,” 1
said 1
holmes. 1
“i 1
think, 1
dr. 1
mortimer, 1
you 1
would 1
do 1
wisely 1
if 1
without 1
more 1
ado 1
you 1
would 1
kindly 1
tell 1
me 1
plainly 1
what 1
the 1
exact 1
nature 1
of 1
the 1
problem 1
is 1
in 1
which 1
you 1
demand 1
my 1
assistance.” 1
chapter 1
2. 1
the 1
curse 1
of 1
the 1
baskervilles 1
“i 1
have 1
in 1
my 1
pocket 1
a 1
manuscript,” 1
said 1
dr. 1
james 1
mortimer. 1
“i 1
observed 1
it 1
as 1
you 1
entered 1
the 1
room,” 1
said 1
holmes. 1
“it 1
is 1
an 1
old 1
manuscript.” 1
“early 1
eighteenth 1
century, 1
unless 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
forgery.” 1
“how 1
can 1
you 1
say 1
that, 1
sir?” 1
“you 1
have 1
presented 1
an 1
inch 1
or 1
two 1
of 1
it 1
to 1
my 1
examination 1
all 1
the 1
time 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
been 1
talking. 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
poor 1
expert 1
who 1
could 1
not 1
give 1
the 1
date 1
of 1
a 1
document 1
within 1
a 1
decade 1
or 1
so. 1
you 1
may 1
possibly 1
have 1
read 1
my 1
little 1
monograph 1
upon 1
the 1
subject. 1
i 1
put 1
that 1
at 1
1730.” 1
“the 1
exact 1
date 1
is 1
1742.” 1
dr. 1
mortimer 1
drew 1
it 1
from 1
his 1
breast-pocket. 1
“this 1
family 1
paper 1
was 1
committed 1
to 1
my 1
care 1
by 1
sir 1
charles 1
baskerville, 1
whose 1
sudden 1
and 1
tragic 1
death 1
some 1
three 1
months 1
ago 1
created 1
so 1
much 1
excitement 1
in 1
devonshire. 1
i 1
may 1
say 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
his 1
personal 1
friend 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
his 1
medical 1
attendant. 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
strong-minded 1
man, 1
sir, 1
shrewd, 1
practical, 1
and 1
as 1
unimaginative 1
as 1
i 1
am 1
myself. 1
yet 1
he 1
took 1
this 1
document 1
very 1
seriously, 1
and 1
his 1
mind 1
was 1
prepared 1
for 1
just 1
such 1
an 1
end 1
as 1
did 1
eventually 1
overtake 1
him.” 1
holmes 1
stretched 1
out 1
his 1
hand 1
for 1
the 1
manuscript 1
and 1
flattened 1
it 1
upon 1
his 1
knee. 1
“you 1
will 1
observe, 1
watson, 1
the 1
alternative 1
use 1
of 1
the 1
long 1
_s_ 1
and 1
the 1
short. 1
it 1
is 1
one 1
of 1
several 1
indications 1
which 1
enabled 1
me 1
to 1
fix 1
the 1
date.” 1
i 1
looked 1
over 1
his 1
shoulder 1
at 1
the 1
yellow 1
paper 1
and 1
the 1
faded 1
script. 1
at 1
the 1
head 1
was 1
written: 1
“baskerville 1
hall,” 1
and 1
below 1
in 1
large, 1
scrawling 1
figures: 1
“1742.” 1
“it 1
appears 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
statement 1
of 1
some 1
sort.” 1
“yes, 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
statement 1
of 1
a 1
certain 1
legend 1
which 1
runs 1
in 1
the 1
baskerville 1
family.” 1
“but 1
i 1
understand 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
something 1
more 1
modern 1
and 1
practical 1
upon 1
which 1
you 1
wish 1
to 1
consult 1
me?” 1
“most 1
modern. 1
a 1
most 1
practical, 1
pressing 1
matter, 1
which 1
must 1
be 1
decided 1
within 1
twenty-four 1
hours. 1
but 1
the 1
manuscript 1
is 1
short 1
and 1
is 1
intimately 1
connected 1
with 1
the 1
affair. 1
with 1
your 1
permission 1
i 1
will 1
read 1
it 1
to 1
you.” 1
holmes 1
leaned 1
back 1
in 1
his 1
chair, 1
placed 1
his 1
finger-tips 1
together, 1
and 1
closed 1
his 1
eyes, 1
with 1
an 1
air 1
of 1
resignation. 1
dr. 1
mortimer 1
turned 1
the 1
manuscript 1
to 1
the 1
light 1
and 1
read 1
in 1
a 1
high, 1
cracking 1
voice 1
the 1
following 1
curious, 1
old-world 1
narrative: 1
“of 1
the 1
origin 1
of 1
the 1
hound 1
of 1
the 1
baskervilles 1
there 1
have 1
been 1
many 1
statements, 1
yet 1
as 1
i 1
come 1
in 1
a 1
direct 1
line 1
from 1
hugo 1
baskerville, 1
and 1
as 1
i 1
had 1
the 1
story 1
from 1
my 1
father, 1
who 1
also 1
had 1
it 1
from 1
his, 1
i 1
have 1
set 1
it 1
down 1
with 1
all 1
belief 1
that 1
it 1
occurred 1
even 1
as 1
is 1
here 1
set 1
forth. 1
and 1
i 1
would 1
have 1
you 1
believe, 1
my 1
sons, 1
that 1
the 1
same 1
justice 1
which 1
punishes 1
sin 1
may 1
also 1
most 1
graciously 1
forgive 1
it, 1
and 1
that 1
no 1
ban 1
is 1
so 1
heavy 1
but 1
that 1
by 1
prayer 1
and 1
repentance 1
it 1
may 1
be 1
removed. 1
learn 1
then 1
from 1
this 1
story 1
not 1
to 1
fear 1
the 1
fruits 1
of 1
the 1
past, 1
but 1
rather 1
to 1
be 1
circumspect 1
in 1
the 1
future, 1
that 1
those 1
foul 1
passions 1
whereby 1
our 1
family 1
has 1
suffered 1
so 1
grievously 1
may 1
not 1
again 1
be 1
loosed 1
to 1
our 1
undoing. 1
“know 1
then 1
that 1
in 1
the 1
time 1
of 1
the 1
great 1
rebellion 1
(the 1
history 1
of 1
which 1
by 1
the 1
learned 1
lord 1
clarendon 1
i 1
most 1
earnestly 1
commend 1
to 1
your 1
attention) 1
this 1
manor 1
of 1
baskerville 1
was 1
held 1
by 1
hugo 1
of 1
that 1
name, 1
nor 1
can 1
it 1
be 1
gainsaid 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
most 1
wild, 1
profane, 1
and 1
godless 1
man. 1
this, 1
in 1
truth, 1
his 1
neighbours 1
might 1
have 1
pardoned, 1
seeing 1
that 1
saints 1
have 1
never 1
flourished 1
in 1
those 1
parts, 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
in 1
him 1
a 1
certain 1
wanton 1
and 1
cruel 1
humour 1
which 1
made 1
his 1
name 1
a 1
by-word 1
through 1
the 1
west. 1
it 1
chanced 1
that 1
this 1
hugo 1
came 1
to 1
love 1
(if, 1
indeed, 1
so 1
dark 1
a 1
passion 1
may 1
be 1
known 1
under 1
so 1
bright 1
a 1
name) 1
the 1
daughter 1
of 1
a 1
yeoman 1
who 1
held 1
lands 1
near 1
the 1
baskerville 1
estate. 1
but 1
the 1
young 1
maiden, 1
being 1
discreet 1
and 1
of 1
good 1
repute, 1
would 1
ever 1
avoid 1
him, 1
for 1
she 1
feared 1
his 1
evil 1
name. 1
so 1
it 1
came 1
to 1
pass 1
that 1
one 1
michaelmas 1
this 1
hugo, 1
with 1
five 1
or 1
six 1
of 1
his 1
idle 1
and 1
wicked 1
companions, 1
stole 1
down 1
upon 1
the 1
farm 1
and 1
carried 1
off 1
the 1
maiden, 1
her 1
father 1
and 1
brothers 1
being 1
from 1
home, 1
as 1
he 1
well 1
knew. 1
when 1
they 1
had 1
brought 1
her 1
to 1
the 1
hall 1
the 1
maiden 1
was 1
placed 1
in 1
an 1
upper 1
chamber, 1
while 1
hugo 1
and 1
his 1
friends 1
sat 1
down 1
to 1
a 1
long 1
carouse, 1
as 1
was 1
their 1
nightly 1
custom. 1
now, 1
the 1
poor 1
lass 1
upstairs 1
was 1
like 1
to 1
have 1
her 1
wits 1
turned 1
at 1
the 1
singing 1
and 1
shouting 1
and 1
terrible 1
oaths 1
which 1
came 1
up 1
to 1
her 1
from 1
below, 1
for 1
they 1
say 1
that 1
the 1
words 1
used 1
by 1
hugo 1
baskerville, 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
in 1
wine, 1
were 1
such 1
as 1
might 1
blast 1
the 1
man 1
who 1
said 1
them. 1
at 1
last 1
in 1
the 1
stress 1
of 1
her 1
fear 1
she 1
did 1
that 1
which 1
might 1
have 1
daunted 1
the 1
bravest 1
or 1
most 1
active 1
man, 1
for 1
by 1
the 1
aid 1
of 1
the 1
growth 1
of 1
ivy 1
which 1
covered 1
(and 1
still 1
covers) 1
the 1
south 1
wall 1
she 1
came 1
down 1
from 1
under 1
the 1
eaves, 1
and 1
so 1
homeward 1
across 1
the 1
moor, 1
there 1
being 1
three 1
leagues 1
betwixt 1
the 1
hall 1
and 1
her 1
father’s 1
farm. 1
“it 1
chanced 1
that 1
some 1
little 1
time 1
later 1
hugo 1
left 1
his 1
guests 1
to 1
carry 1
food 1
and 1
drink—with 1
other 1
worse 1
things, 1
perchance—to 1
his 1
captive, 1
and 1
so 1
found 1
the 1
cage 1
empty 1
and 1
the 1
bird 1
escaped. 1
then, 1
as 1
it 1
would 1
seem, 1
he 1
became 1
as 1
one 1
that 1
hath 1
a 1
devil, 1
for, 1
rushing 1
down 1
the 1
stairs 1
into 1
the 1
dining-hall, 1
he 1
sprang 1
upon 1
the 1
great 1
table, 1
flagons 1
and 1
trenchers 1
flying 1
before 1
him, 1
and 1
he 1
cried 1
aloud 1
before 1
all 1
the 1
company 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
that 1
very 1
night 1
render 1
his 1
body 1
and 1
soul 1
to 1
the 1
powers 1
of 1
evil 1
if 1
he 1
might 1
but 1
overtake 1
the 1
wench. 1
and 1
while 1
the 1
revellers 1
stood 1
aghast 1
at 1
the 1
fury 1
of 1
the 1
man, 1
one 1
more 1
wicked 1
or, 1
it 1
may 1
be, 1
more 1
drunken 1
than 1
the 1
rest, 1
cried 1
out 1
that 1
they 1
should 1
put 1
the 1
hounds 1
upon 1
her. 1
whereat 1
hugo 1
ran 1
from 1
the 1
house, 1
crying 1
to 1
his 1
grooms 1
that 1
they 1
should 1
saddle 1
his 1
mare 1
and 1
unkennel 1
the 1
pack, 1
and 1
giving 1
the 1
hounds 1
a 1
kerchief 1
of 1
the 1
maid’s, 1
he 1
swung 1
them 1
to 1
the 1
line, 1
and 1
so 1
off 1
full 1
cry 1
in 1
the 1
moonlight 1
over 1
the 1
moor. 1
“now, 1
for 1
some 1
space 1
the 1
revellers 1
stood 1
agape, 1
unable 1
to 1
understand 1
all 1
that 1
had 1
been 1
done 1
in 1
such 1
haste. 1
but 1
anon 1
their 1
bemused 1
wits 1
awoke 1
to 1
the 1
nature 1
of 1
the 1
deed 1
which 1
was 1
like 1
to 1
be 1
done 1
upon 1
the 1
moorlands. 1
everything 1
was 1
now 1
in 1
an 1
uproar, 1
some 1
calling 1
for 1
their 1
pistols, 1
some 1
for 1
their 1
horses, 1
and 1
some 1
for 1
another 1
flask 1
of 1
wine. 1
but 1
at 1
length 1
some 1
sense 1
came 1
back 1
to 1
their 1
crazed 1
minds, 1
and 1
the 1
whole 1
of 1
them, 1
thirteen 1
in 1
number, 1
took 1
horse 1
and 1
started 1
in 1
pursuit. 1
the 1
moon 1
shone 1
clear 1
above 1
them, 1
and 1
they 1
rode 1
swiftly 1
abreast, 1
taking 1
that 1
course 1
which 1
the 1
maid 1
must 1
needs 1
have 1
taken 1
if 1
she 1
were 1
to 1
reach 1
her 1
own 1
home. 1
“they 1
had 1
gone 1
a 1
mile 1
or 1
two 1
when 1
they 1
passed 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
night 1
shepherds 1
upon 1
the 1
moorlands, 1
and 1
they 1
cried 1
to 1
him 1
to 1
know 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
seen 1
the 1
hunt. 1
and 1
the 1
man, 1
as 1
the 1
story 1
goes, 1
was 1
so 1
crazed 1
with 1
fear 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
scarce 1
speak, 1
but 1
at 1
last 1
he 1
said 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
indeed 1
seen 1
the 1
unhappy 1
maiden, 1
with 1
the 1
hounds 1
upon 1
her 1
track. 1
‘but 1
i 1
have 1
seen 1
more 1
than 1
that,’ 1
said 1
he, 1
‘for 1
hugo 1
baskerville 1
passed 1
me 1
upon 1
his 1
black 1
mare, 1
and 1
there 1
ran 1
mute 1
behind 1
him 1
such 1
a 1
hound 1
of 1
hell 1
as 1
god 1
forbid 1
should 1
ever 1
be 1
at 1
my 1
heels.’ 1
so 1
the 1
drunken 1
squires 1
cursed 1
the 1
shepherd 1
and 1
rode 1
onward. 1
but 1
soon 1
their 1
skins 1
turned 1
cold, 1
for 1
there 1
came 1
a 1
galloping 1
across 1
the 1
moor, 1
and 1
the 1
black 1
mare, 1
dabbled 1
with 1
white 1
froth, 1
went 1
past 1
with 1
trailing 1
bridle 1
and 1
empty 1
saddle. 1
then 1
the 1
revellers 1
rode 1
close 1
together, 1
for 1
a 1
great 1
fear 1
was 1
on 1
them, 1
but 1
they 1
still 1
followed 1
over 1
the 1
moor, 1
though 1
each, 1
had 1
he 1
been 1
alone, 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
right 1
glad 1
to 1
have 1
turned 1
his 1
horse’s 1
head. 1
riding 1
slowly 1
in 1
this 1
fashion 1
they 1
came 1
at 1
last 1
upon 1
the 1
hounds. 1
these, 1
though 1
known 1
for 1
their 1
valour 1
and 1
their 1
breed, 1
were 1
whimpering 1
in 1
a 1
cluster 1
at 1
the 1
head 1
of 1
a 1
deep 1
dip 1
or 1
goyal, 1
as 1
we 1
call 1
it, 1
upon 1
the 1
moor, 1
some 1
slinking 1
away 1
and 1
some, 1
with 1
starting 1
hackles 1
and 1
staring 1
eyes, 1
gazing 1
down 1
the 1
narrow 1
valley 1
before 1
them. 1
“the 1
company 1
had 1
come 1
to 1
a 1
halt, 1
more 1
sober 1
men, 1
as 1
you 1
may 1
guess, 1
than 1
when 1
they 1
started. 1
the 1
most 1
of 1
them 1
would 1
by 1
no 1
means 1
advance, 1
but 1
three 1
of 1
them, 1
the 1
boldest, 1
or 1
it 1
may 1
be 1
the 1
most 1
drunken, 1
rode 1
forward 1
down 1
the 1
goyal. 1
now, 1
it 1
opened 1
into 1
a 1
broad 1
space 1
in 1
which 1
stood 1
two 1
of 1
those 1
great 1
stones, 1
still 1
to 1
be 1
seen 1
there, 1
which 1
were 1
set 1
by 1
certain 1
forgotten 1
peoples 1
in 1
the 1
days 1
of 1
old. 1
the 1
moon 1
was 1
shining 1
bright 1
upon 1
the 1
clearing, 1
and 1
there 1
in 1
the 1
centre 1
lay 1
the 1
unhappy 1
maid 1
where 1
she 1
had 1
fallen, 1
dead 1
of 1
fear 1
and 1
of 1
fatigue. 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
the 1
sight 1
of 1
her 1
body, 1
nor 1
yet 1
was 1
it 1
that 1
of 1
the 1
body 1
of 1
hugo 1
baskerville 1
lying 1
near 1
her, 1
which 1
raised 1
the 1
hair 1
upon 1
the 1
heads 1
of 1
these 1
three 1
dare-devil 1
roysterers, 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
that, 1
standing 1
over 1
hugo, 1
and 1
plucking 1
at 1
his 1
throat, 1
there 1
stood 1
a 1
foul 1
thing, 1
a 1
great, 1
black 1
beast, 1
shaped 1
like 1
a 1
hound, 1
yet 1
larger 1
than 1
any 1
hound 1
that 1
ever 1
mortal 1
eye 1
has 1
rested 1
upon. 1
and 1
even 1
as 1
they 1
looked 1
the 1
thing 1
tore 1
the 1
throat 1
out 1
of 1
hugo 1
baskerville, 1
on 1
which, 1
as 1
it 1
turned 1
its 1
blazing 1
eyes 1
and 1
dripping 1
jaws 1
upon 1
them, 1
the 1
three 1
shrieked 1
with 1
fear 1
and 1
rode 1
for 1
dear 1
life, 1
still 1
screaming, 1
across 1
the 1
moor. 1
one, 1
it 1
is 1
said, 1
died 1
that 1
very 1
night 1
of 1
what 1
he 1
had 1
seen, 1
and 1
the 1
other 1
twain 1
were 1
but 1
broken 1
men 1
for 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
their 1
days. 1
“such 1
is 1
the 1
tale, 1
my 1
sons, 1
of 1
the 1
coming 1
of 1
the 1
hound 1
which 1
is 1
said 1
to 1
have 1
plagued 1
the 1
family 1
so 1
sorely 1
ever 1
since. 1
if 1
i 1
have 1
set 1
it 1
down 1
it 1
is 1
because 1
that 1
which 1
is 1
clearly 1
known 1
hath 1
less 1
terror 1
than 1
that 1
which 1
is 1
but 1
hinted 1
at 1
and 1
guessed. 1
nor 1
can 1
it 1
be 1
denied 1
that 1
many 1
of 1
the 1
family 1
have 1
been 1
unhappy 1
in 1
their 1
deaths, 1
which 1
have 1
been 1
sudden, 1
bloody, 1
and 1
mysterious. 1
yet 1
may 1
we 1
shelter 1
ourselves 1
in 1
the 1
infinite 1
goodness 1
of 1
providence, 1
which 1
would 1
not 1
forever 1
punish 1
the 1
innocent 1
beyond 1
that 1
third 1
or 1
fourth 1
generation 1
which 1
is 1
threatened 1
in 1
holy 1
writ. 1
to 1
that 1
providence, 1
my 1
sons, 1
i 1
hereby 1
commend 1
you, 1
and 1
i 1
counsel 1
you 1
by 1
way 1
of 1
caution 1
to 1
forbear 1
from 1
crossing 1
the 1
moor 1
in 1
those 1
dark 1
hours 1
when 1
the 1
powers 1
of 1
evil 1
are 1
exalted. 1
“[this 1
from 1
hugo 1
baskerville 1
to 1
his 1
sons 1
rodger 1
and 1
john, 1
with 1
instructions 1
that 1
they 1
say 1
nothing 1
thereof 1
to 1
their 1
sister 1
elizabeth.]” 1
when 1
dr. 1
mortimer 1
had 1
finished 1
reading 1
this 1
singular 1
narrative 1
he 1
pushed 1
his 1
spectacles 1
up 1
on 1
his 1
forehead 1
and 1
stared 1
across 1
at 1
mr. 1
sherlock 1
holmes. 1
the 1
latter 1
yawned 1
and 1
tossed 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
his 1
cigarette 1
into 1
the 1
fire. 1
“well?” 1
said 1
he. 1
“do 1
you 1
not 1
find 1
it 1
interesting?” 1
“to 1
a 1
collector 1
of 1
fairy 1
tales.” 1
dr. 1
mortimer 1
drew 1
a 1
folded 1
newspaper 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
pocket. 1
“now, 1
mr. 1
holmes, 1
we 1
will 1
give 1
you 1
something 1
a 1
little 1
more 1
recent. 1
this 1
is 1
the 1
_devon 1
county 1
chronicle_ 1
of 1
may 1
14th 1
of 1
this 1
year. 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
short 1
account 1
of 1
the 1
facts 1
elicited 1
at 1
the 1
death 1
of 1
sir 1
charles 1
baskerville 1
which 1
occurred 1
a 1
few 1
days 1
before 1
that 1
date.” 1
my 1
friend 1
leaned 1
a 1
little 1
forward 1
and 1
his 1
expression 1
became 1
intent. 1
our 1
visitor 1
readjusted 1
his 1
glasses 1
and 1
began: 1
“the 1
recent 1
sudden 1
death 1
of 1
sir 1
charles 1
baskerville, 1
whose 1
name 1
has 1
been 1
mentioned 1
as 1
the 1
probable 1
liberal 1
candidate 1
for 1
mid-devon 1
at 1
the 1
next 1
election, 1
has 1
cast 1
a 1
gloom 1
over 1
the 1
county. 1
though 1
sir 1
charles 1
had 1
resided 1
at 1
baskerville 1
hall 1
for 1
a 1
comparatively 1
short 1
period 1
his 1
amiability 1
of 1
character 1
and 1
extreme 1
generosity 1
had 1
won 1
the 1
affection 1
and 1
respect 1
of 1
all 1
who 1
had 1
been 1
brought 1
into 1
contact 1
with 1
him. 1
in 1
these 1
days 1
of 1
_nouveaux 1
riches_ 1
it 1
is 1
refreshing 1
to 1
find 1
a 1
case 1
where 1
the 1
scion 1
of 1
an 1
old 1
county 1
family 1
which 1
has 1
fallen 1
upon 1
evil 1
days 1
is 1
able 1
to 1
make 1
his 1
own 1
fortune 1
and 1
to 1
bring 1
it 1
back 1
with 1
him 1
to 1
restore 1
the 1
fallen 1
grandeur 1
of 1
his 1
line. 1
sir 1
charles, 1
as 1
is 1
well 1
known, 1
made 1
large 1
sums 1
of 1
money 1
in 1
south 1
african 1
speculation. 1
more 1
wise 1
than 1
those 1
who 1
go 1
on 1
until 1
the 1
wheel 1
turns 1
against 1
them, 1
he 1
realised 1
his 1
gains 1
and 1
returned 1
to 1
england 1
with 1
them. 1
it 1
is 1
only 1
two 1
years 1
since 1
he 1
took 1
up 1
his 1
residence 1
at 1
baskerville 1
hall, 1
and 1
it 1
is 1
common 1
talk 1
how 1
large 1
were 1
those 1
schemes 1
of 1
reconstruction 1
and 1
improvement 1
which 1
have 1
been 1
interrupted 1
by 1
his 1
death. 1
being 1
himself 1
childless, 1
it 1
was 1
his 1
openly 1
expressed 1
desire 1
that 1
the 1
whole 1
countryside 1
should, 1
within 1
his 1
own 1
lifetime, 1
profit 1
by 1
his 1
good 1
fortune, 1
and 1
many 1
will 1
have 1
personal 1
reasons 1
for 1
bewailing 1
his 1
untimely 1
end. 1
his 1
generous 1
donations 1
to 1
local 1
and 1
county 1
charities 1
have 1
been 1
frequently 1
chronicled 1
in 1
these 1
columns. 1
“the 1
circumstances 1
connected 1
with 1
the 1
death 1
of 1
sir 1
charles 1
cannot 1
be 1
said 1
to 1
have 1
been 1
entirely 1
cleared 1
up 1
by 1
the 1
inquest, 1
but 1
at 1
least 1
enough 1
has 1
been 1
done 1
to 1
dispose 1
of 1
those 1
rumours 1
to 1
which 1
local 1
superstition 1
has 1
given 1
rise. 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
reason 1
whatever 1
to 1
suspect 1
foul 1
play, 1
or 1
to 1
imagine 1
that 1
death 1
could 1
be 1
from 1
any 1
but 1
natural 1
causes. 1
sir 1
charles 1
was 1
a 1
widower, 1
and 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
may 1
be 1
said 1
to 1
have 1
been 1
in 1
some 1
ways 1
of 1
an 1
eccentric 1
habit 1
of 1
mind. 1
in 1
spite 1
of 1
his 1
considerable 1
wealth 1
he 1
was 1
simple 1
in 1
his 1
personal 1
tastes, 1
and 1
his 1
indoor 1
servants 1
at 1
baskerville 1
hall 1
consisted 1
of 1
a 1
married 1
couple 1
named 1
barrymore, 1
the 1
husband 1
acting 1
as 1
butler 1
and 1
the 1
wife 1
as 1
housekeeper. 1
their 1
evidence, 1
corroborated 1
by 1
that 1
of 1
several 1
friends, 1
tends 1
to 1
show 1
that 1
sir 1
charles’s 1
health 1
has 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
been 1
impaired, 1
and 1
points 1
especially 1
to 1
some 1
affection 1
of 1
the 1
heart, 1
manifesting 1
itself 1
in 1
changes 1
of 1
colour, 1
breathlessness, 1
and 1
acute 1
attacks 1
of 1
nervous 1
depression. 1
dr. 1
james 1
mortimer, 1
the 1
friend 1
and 1
medical 1
attendant 1
of 1
the 1
deceased, 1
has 1
given 1
evidence 1
to 1
the 1
same 1
effect. 1
“the 1
facts 1
of 1
the 1
case 1
are 1
simple. 1
sir 1
charles 1
baskerville 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
habit 1
every 1
night 1
before 1
going 1
to 1
bed 1
of 1
walking 1
down 1
the 1
famous 1
yew 1
alley 1
of 1
baskerville 1
hall. 1
the 1
evidence 1
of 1
the 1
barrymores 1
shows 1
that 1
this 1
had 1
been 1
his 1
custom. 1
on 1
the 1
fourth 1
of 1
may 1
sir 1
charles 1
had 1
declared 1
his 1
intention 1
of 1
starting 1
next 1
day 1
for 1
london, 1
and 1
had 1
ordered 1
barrymore 1
to 1
prepare 1
his 1
luggage. 1
that 1
night 1
he 1
went 1
out 1
as 1
usual 1
for 1
his 1
nocturnal 1
walk, 1
in 1
the 1
course 1
of 1
which 1
he 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
habit 1
of 1
smoking 1
a 1
cigar. 1
he 1
never 1
returned. 1
at 1
twelve 1
o’clock 1
barrymore, 1
finding 1
the 1
hall 1
door 1
still 1
open, 1
became 1
alarmed, 1
and, 1
lighting 1
a 1
lantern, 1
went 1
in 1
search 1
of 1
his 1
master. 1
the 1
day 1
had 1
been 1
wet, 1
and 1
sir 1
charles’s 1
footmarks 1
were 1
easily 1
traced 1
down 1
the 1
alley. 1
halfway 1
down 1
this 1
walk 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
gate 1
which 1
leads 1
out 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
moor. 1
there 1
were 1
indications 1
that 1
sir 1
charles 1
had 1
stood 1
for 1
some 1
little 1
time 1
here. 1
he 1
then 1
proceeded 1
down 1
the 1
alley, 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
at 1
the 1
far 1
end 1
of 1
it 1
that 1
his 1
body 1
was 1
discovered. 1
one 1
fact 1
which 1
has 1
not 1
been 1
explained 1
is 1
the 1
statement 1
of 1
barrymore 1
that 1
his 1
master’s 1
footprints 1
altered 1
their 1
character 1
from 1
the 1
time 1
that 1
he 1
passed 1
the 1
moor-gate, 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
appeared 1
from 1
thence 1
onward 1
to 1
have 1
been 1
walking 1
upon 1
his 1
toes. 1
one 1
murphy, 1
a 1
gipsy 1
horse-dealer, 1
was 1
on 1
the 1
moor 1
at 1
no 1
great 1
distance 1
at 1
the 1
time, 1
but 1
he 1
appears 1
by 1
his 1
own 1
confession 1
to 1
have 1
been 1
the 1
worse 1
for 1
drink. 1
he 1
declares 1
that 1
he 1
heard 1
cries 1
but 1
is 1
unable 1
to 1
state 1
from 1
what 1
direction 1
they 1
came. 1
no 1
signs 1
of 1
violence 1
were 1
to 1
be 1
discovered 1
upon 1
sir 1
charles’s 1
person, 1
and 1
though 1
the 1
doctor’s 1
evidence 1
pointed 1
to 1
an 1
almost 1
incredible 1
facial 1
distortion—so 1
great 1
that 1
dr. 1
mortimer 1
refused 1
at 1
first 1
to 1
believe 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
indeed 1
his 1
friend 1
and 1
patient 1
who 1
lay 1
before 1
him—it 1
was 1
explained 1
that 1
that 1
is 1
a 1
symptom 1
which 1
is 1
not 1
unusual 1
in 1
cases 1
of 1
dyspnœa 1
and 1
death 1
from 1
cardiac 1
exhaustion. 1
this 1
explanation 1
was 1
borne 1
out 1
by 1
the 1
post-mortem 1
examination, 1
which 1
showed 1
long-standing 1
organic 1
disease, 1
and 1
the 1
coroner’s 1
jury 1
returned 1
a 1
verdict 1
in 1
accordance 1
with 1
the 1
medical 1
evidence. 1
it 1
is 1
well 1
that 1
this 1
is 1
so, 1
for 1
it 1
is 1
obviously 1
of 1
the 1
utmost 1
importance 1
that 1
sir 1
charles’s 1
heir 1
should 1
settle 1
at 1
the 1
hall 1
and 1
continue 1
the 1
good 1
work 1
which 1
has 1
been 1
so 1
sadly 1
interrupted. 1
had 1
the 1
prosaic 1
finding 1
of 1
the 1
coroner 1
not 1
finally 1
put 1
an 1
end 1
to 1
the 1
romantic 1
stories 1
which 1
have 1
been 1
whispered 1
in 1
connection 1
with 1
the 1
affair, 1
it 1
might 1
have 1
been 1
difficult 1
to 1
find 1
a 1
tenant 1
for 1
baskerville 1
hall. 1
it 1
is 1
understood 1
that 1
the 1
next 1
of 1
kin 1
is 1
mr. 1
henry 1
baskerville, 1
if 1
he 1
be 1
still 1
alive, 1
the 1
son 1
of 1
sir 1
charles 1
baskerville’s 1
younger 1
brother. 1
the 1
young 1
man 1
when 1
last 1
heard 1
of 1
was 1
in 1
america, 1
and 1
inquiries 1
are 1
being 1
instituted 1
with 1
a 1
view 1
to 1
informing 1
him 1
of 1
his 1
good 1
fortune.” 1
dr. 1
mortimer 1
refolded 1
his 1
paper 1
and 1
replaced 1
it 1
in 1
his 1
pocket. 1
“those 1
are 1
the 1
public 1
facts, 1
mr. 1
holmes, 1
in 1
connection 1
with 1
the 1
death 1
of 1
sir 1
charles 1
baskerville.” 1
“i 1
must 1
thank 1
you,” 1
said 1
sherlock 1
holmes, 1
“for 1
calling 1
my 1
attention 1
to 1
a 1
case 1
which 1
certainly 1
presents 1
some 1
features 1
of 1
interest. 1
i 1
had 1
observed 1
some 1
newspaper 1
comment 1
at 1
the 1
time, 1
but 1
i 1
was 1
exceedingly 1
preoccupied 1
by 1
that 1
little 1
affair 1
of 1
the 1
vatican 1
cameos, 1
and 1
in 1
my 1
anxiety 1
to 1
oblige 1
the 1
pope 1
i 1
lost 1
touch 1
with 1
several 1
interesting 1
english 1
cases. 1
this 1
article, 1
you 1
say, 1
contains 1
all 1
the 1
public 1
facts?” 1
“it 1
does.” 1
“then 1
let 1
me 1
have 1
the 1
private 1
ones.” 1
he 1
leaned 1
back, 1
put 1
his 1
finger-tips 1
together, 1
and 1
assumed 1
his 1
most 1
impassive 1
and 1
judicial 1
expression. 1
“in 1
doing 1
so,” 1
said 1
dr. 1
mortimer, 1
who 1
had 1
begun 1
to 1
show 1
signs 1
of 1
some 1
strong 1
emotion, 1
“i 1
am 1
telling 1
that 1
which 1
i 1
have 1
not 1
confided 1
to 1
anyone. 1
my 1
motive 1
for 1
withholding 1
it 1
from 1
the 1
coroner’s 1
inquiry 1
is 1
that 1
a 1
man 1
of 1
science 1
shrinks 1
from 1
placing 1
himself 1
in 1
the 1
public 1
position 1
of 1
seeming 1
to 1
indorse 1
a 1
popular 1
superstition. 1
i 1
had 1
the 1
further 1
motive 1
that 1
baskerville 1
hall, 1
as 1
the 1
paper 1
says, 1
would 1
certainly 1
remain 1
untenanted 1
if 1
anything 1
were 1
done 1
to 1
increase 1
its 1
already 1
rather 1
grim 1
reputation. 1
for 1
both 1
these 1
reasons 1
i 1
thought 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
justified 1
in 1
telling 1
rather 1
less 1
than 1
i 1
knew, 1
since 1
no 1
practical 1
good 1
could 1
result 1
from 1
it, 1
but 1
with 1
you 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
reason 1
why 1
i 1
should 1
not 1
be 1
perfectly 1
frank. 1
“the 1
moor 1
is 1
very 1
sparsely 1
inhabited, 1
and 1
those 1
who 1
live 1
near 1
each 1
other 1
are 1
thrown 1
very 1
much 1
together. 1
for 1
this 1
reason 1
i 1
saw 1
a 1
good 1
deal 1
of 1
sir 1
charles 1
baskerville. 1
with 1
the 1
exception 1
of 1
mr. 1
frankland, 1
of 1
lafter 1
hall, 1
and 1
mr. 1
stapleton, 1
the 1
naturalist, 1
there 1
are 1
no 1
other 1
men 1
of 1
education 1
within 1
many 1
miles. 1
sir 1
charles 1
was 1
a 1
retiring 1
man, 1
but 1
the 1
chance 1
of 1
his 1
illness 1
brought 1
us 1
together, 1
and 1
a 1
community 1
of 1
interests 1
in 1
science 1
kept 1
us 1
so. 1
he 1
had 1
brought 1
back 1
much 1
scientific 1
information 1
from 1
south 1
africa, 1
and 1
many 1
a 1
charming 1
evening 1
we 1
have 1
spent 1
together 1
discussing 1
the 1
comparative 1
anatomy 1
of 1
the 1
bushman 1
and 1
the 1
hottentot. 1
“within 1
the 1
last 1
few 1
months 1
it 1
became 1
increasingly 1
plain 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
sir 1
charles’s 1
nervous 1
system 1
was 1
strained 1
to 1
the 1
breaking 1
point. 1
he 1
had 1
taken 1
this 1
legend 1
which 1
i 1
have 1
read 1
you 1
exceedingly 1
to 1
heart—so 1
much 1
so 1
that, 1
although 1
he 1
would 1
walk 1
in 1
his 1
own 1
grounds, 1
nothing 1
would 1
induce 1
him 1
to 1
go 1
out 1
upon 1
the 1
moor 1
at 1
night. 1
incredible 1
as 1
it 1
may 1
appear 1
to 1
you, 1
mr. 1
holmes, 1
he 1
was 1
honestly 1
convinced 1
that 1
a 1
dreadful 1
fate 1
overhung 1
his 1
family, 1
and 1
certainly 1
the 1
records 1
which 1
he 1
was 1
able 1
to 1
give 1
of 1
his 1
ancestors 1
were 1
not 1
encouraging. 1
the 1
idea 1
of 1
some 1
ghastly 1
presence 1
constantly 1
haunted 1
him, 1
and 1
on 1
more 1
than 1
one 1
occasion 1
he 1
has 1
asked 1
me 1
whether 1
i 1
had 1
on 1
my 1
medical 1
journeys 1
at 1
night 1
ever 1
seen 1
any 1
strange 1
creature 1
or 1
heard 1
the 1
baying 1
of 1
a 1
hound. 1
the 1
latter 1
question 1
he 1
put 1
to 1
me 1
several 1
times, 1
and 1
always 1
with 1
a 1
voice 1
which 1
vibrated 1
with 1
excitement. 1
“i 1
can 1
well 1
remember 1
driving 1
up 1
to 1
his 1
house 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
some 1
three 1
weeks 1
before 1
the 1
fatal 1
event. 1
he 1
chanced 1
to 1
be 1
at 1
his 1
hall 1
door. 1
i 1
had 1
descended 1
from 1
my 1
gig 1
and 1
was 1
standing 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
him, 1
when 1
i 1
saw 1
his 1
eyes 1
fix 1
themselves 1
over 1
my 1
shoulder 1
and 1
stare 1
past 1
me 1
with 1
an 1
expression 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
dreadful 1
horror. 1
i 1
whisked 1
round 1
and 1
had 1
just 1
time 1
to 1
catch 1
a 1
glimpse 1
of 1
something 1
which 1
i 1
took 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
large 1
black 1
calf 1
passing 1
at 1
the 1
head 1
of 1
the 1
drive. 1
so 1
excited 1
and 1
alarmed 1
was 1
he 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
compelled 1
to 1
go 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
spot 1
where 1
the 1
animal 1
had 1
been 1
and 1
look 1
around 1
for 1
it. 1
it 1
was 1
gone, 1
however, 1
and 1
the 1
incident 1
appeared 1
to 1
make 1
the 1
worst 1
impression 1
upon 1
his 1
mind. 1
i 1
stayed 1
with 1
him 1
all 1
the 1
evening, 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
on 1
that 1
occasion, 1
to 1
explain 1
the 1
emotion 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
shown, 1
that 1
he 1
confided 1
to 1
my 1
keeping 1
that 1
narrative 1
which 1
i 1
read 1
to 1
you 1
when 1
first 1
i 1
came. 1
i 1
mention 1
this 1
small 1
episode 1
because 1
it 1
assumes 1
some 1
importance 1
in 1
view 1
of 1
the 1
tragedy 1
which 1
followed, 1
but 1
i 1
was 1
convinced 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
that 1
the 1
matter 1
was 1
entirely 1
trivial 1
and 1
that 1
his 1
excitement 1
had 1
no 1
justification. 1
“it 1
was 1
at 1
my 1
advice 1
that 1
sir 1
charles 1
was 1
about 1
to 1
go 1
to 1
london. 1
his 1
heart 1
was, 1
i 1
knew, 1
affected, 1
and 1
the 1
constant 1
anxiety 1
in 1
which 1
he 1
lived, 1
however 1
chimerical 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
it 1
might 1
be, 1
was 1
evidently 1
having 1
a 1
serious 1
effect 1
upon 1
his 1
health. 1
i 1
thought 1
that 1
a 1
few 1
months 1
among 1
the 1
distractions 1
of 1
town 1
would 1
send 1
him 1
back 1
a 1
new 1
man. 1
mr. 1
stapleton, 1
a 1
mutual 1
friend 1
who 1
was 1
much 1
concerned 1
at 1
his 1
state 1
of 1
health, 1
was 1
of 1
the 1
same 1
opinion. 1
at 1
the 1
last 1
instant 1
came 1
this 1
terrible 1
catastrophe. 1
“on 1
the 1
night 1
of 1
sir 1
charles’s 1
death 1
barrymore 1
the 1
butler, 1
who 1
made 1
the 1
discovery, 1
sent 1
perkins 1
the 1
groom 1
on 1
horseback 1
to 1
me, 1
and 1
as 1
i 1
was 1
sitting 1
up 1
late 1
i 1
was 1
able 1
to 1
reach 1
baskerville 1
hall 1
within 1
an 1
hour 1
of 1
the 1
event. 1
i 1
checked 1
and 1
corroborated 1
all 1
the 1
facts 1
which 1
were 1
mentioned 1
at 1
the 1
inquest. 1
i 1
followed 1
the 1
footsteps 1
down 1
the 1
yew 1
alley, 1
i 1
saw 1
the 1
spot 1
at 1
the 1
moor-gate 1
where 1
he 1
seemed 1
to 1
have 1
waited, 1
i 1
remarked 1
the 1
change 1
in 1
the 1
shape 1
of 1
the 1
prints 1
after 1
that 1
point, 1
i 1
noted 1
that 1
there 1
were 1
no 1
other 1
footsteps 1
save 1
those 1
of 1
barrymore 1
on 1
the 1
soft 1
gravel, 1
and 1
finally 1
i 1
carefully 1
examined 1
the 1
body, 1
which 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
touched 1
until 1
my 1
arrival. 1
sir 1
charles 1
lay 1
on 1
his 1
face, 1
his 1
arms 1
out, 1
his 1
fingers 1
dug 1
into 1
the 1
ground, 1
and 1
his 1
features 1
convulsed 1
with 1
some 1
strong 1
emotion 1
to 1
such 1
an 1
extent 1
that 1
i 1
could 1
hardly 1
have 1
sworn 1
to 1
his 1
identity. 1
there 1
was 1
certainly 1
no 1
physical 1
injury 1
of 1
any 1
kind. 1
but 1
one 1
false 1
statement 1
was 1
made 1
by 1
barrymore 1
at 1
the 1
inquest. 1
he 1
said 1
that 1
there 1
were 1
no 1
traces 1
upon 1
the 1
ground 1
round 1
the 1
body. 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
observe 1
any. 1
but 1
i 1
did—some 1
little 1
distance 1
off, 1
but 1
fresh 1
and 1
clear.” 1
“footprints?” 1
“footprints.” 1
“a 1
man’s 1
or 1
a 1
woman’s?” 1
dr. 1
mortimer 1
looked 1
strangely 1
at 1
us 1
for 1
an 1
instant, 1
and 1
his 1
voice 1
sank 1
almost 1
to 1
a 1
whisper 1
as 1
he 1
answered. 1
“mr. 1
holmes, 1
they 1
were 1
the 1
footprints 1
of 1
a 1
gigantic 1
hound!” 1
chapter 1
3. 1
the 1
problem 1
i 1
confess 1
at 1
these 1
words 1
a 1
shudder 1
passed 1
through 1
me. 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
thrill 1
in 1
the 1
doctor’s 1
voice 1
which 1
showed 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
himself 1
deeply 1
moved 1
by 1
that 1
which 1
he 1
told 1
us. 1
holmes 1
leaned 1
forward 1
in 1
his 1
excitement 1
and 1
his 1
eyes 1
had 1
the 1
hard, 1
dry 1
glitter 1
which 1
shot 1
from 1
them 1
when 1
he 1
was 1
keenly 1
interested. 1
“you 1
saw 1
this?” 1
“as 1
clearly 1
as 1
i 1
see 1
you.” 1
“and 1
you 1
said 1
nothing?” 1
“what 1
was 1
the 1
use?” 1
“how 1
was 1
it 1
that 1
no 1
one 1
else 1
saw 1
it?” 1
“the 1
marks 1
were 1
some 1
twenty 1
yards 1
from 1
the 1
body 1
and 1
no 1
one 1
gave 1
them 1
a 1
thought. 1
i 1
don’t 1
suppose 1
i 1
should 1
have 1
done 1
so 1
had 1
i 1
not 1
known 1
this 1
legend.” 1
“there 1
are 1
many 1
sheep-dogs 1
on 1
the 1
moor?” 1
“no 1
doubt, 1
but 1
this 1
was 1
no 1
sheep-dog.” 1
“you 1
say 1
it 1
was 1
large?” 1
“enormous.” 1
“but 1
it 1
had 1
not 1
approached 1
the 1
body?” 1
“no.” 1
“what 1
sort 1
of 1
night 1
was 1
it?’ 1
“damp 1
and 1
raw.” 1
“but 1
not 1
actually 1
raining?” 1
“no.” 1
“what 1
is 1
the 1
alley 1
like?” 1
“there 1
are 1
two 1
lines 1
of 1
old 1
yew 1
hedge, 1
twelve 1
feet 1
high 1
and 1
impenetrable. 1
the 1
walk 1
in 1
the 1
centre 1
is 1
about 1
eight 1
feet 1
across.” 1
“is 1
there 1
anything 1
between 1
the 1
hedges 1
and 1
the 1
walk?” 1
“yes, 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
strip 1
of 1
grass 1
about 1
six 1
feet 1
broad 1
on 1
either 1
side.” 1
“i 1
understand 1
that 1
the 1
yew 1
hedge 1
is 1
penetrated 1
at 1
one 1
point 1
by 1
a 1
gate?” 1
“yes, 1
the 1
wicket-gate 1
which 1
leads 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
moor.” 1
“is 1
there 1
any 1
other 1
opening?” 1
“none.” 1
“so 1
that 1
to 1
reach 1
the 1
yew 1
alley 1
one 1
either 1
has 1
to 1
come 1
down 1
it 1
from 1
the 1
house 1
or 1
else 1
to 1
enter 1
it 1
by 1
the 1
moor-gate?” 1
“there 1
is 1
an 1
exit 1
through 1
a 1
summer-house 1
at 1
the 1
far 1
end.” 1
“had 1
sir 1
charles 1
reached 1
this?” 1
“no; 1
he 1
lay 1
about 1
fifty 1
yards 1
from 1
it.” 1
“now, 1
tell 1
me, 1
dr. 1
mortimer—and 1
this 1
is 1
important—the 1
marks 1
which 1
you 1
saw 1
were 1
on 1
the 1
path 1
and 1
not 1
on 1
the 1
grass?” 1
“no 1
marks 1
could 1
show 1
on 1
the 1
grass.” 1
“were 1
they 1
on 1
the 1
same 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
path 1
as 1
the 1
moor-gate?” 1
“yes; 1
they 1
were 1
on 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
the 1
path 1
on 1
the 1
same 1
side 1
as 1
the 1
moor-gate.” 1
“you 1
interest 1
me 1
exceedingly. 1
another 1
point. 1
was 1
the 1
wicket-gate 1
closed?” 1
“closed 1
and 1
padlocked.” 1
“how 1
high 1
was 1
it?” 1
“about 1
four 1
feet 1
high.” 1
“then 1
anyone 1
could 1
have 1
got 1
over 1
it?” 1
“yes.” 1
“and 1
what 1
marks 1
did 1
you 1
see 1
by 1
the 1
wicket-gate?” 1
“none 1
in 1
particular.” 1
“good 1
heaven! 1
did 1
no 1
one 1
examine?” 1
“yes, 1
i 1
examined, 1
myself.” 1
“and 1
found 1
nothing?” 1
“it 1
was 1
all 1
very 1
confused. 1
sir 1
charles 1
had 1
evidently 1
stood 1
there 1
for 1
five 1
or 1
ten 1
minutes.” 1
“how 1
do 1
you 1
know 1
that?” 1
“because 1
the 1
ash 1
had 1
twice 1
dropped 1
from 1
his 1
cigar.” 1
“excellent! 1
this 1
is 1
a 1
colleague, 1
watson, 1
after 1
our 1
own 1
heart. 1
but 1
the 1
marks?” 1
“he 1
had 1
left 1
his 1
own 1
marks 1
all 1
over 1
that 1
small 1
patch 1
of 1
gravel. 1
i 1
could 1
discern 1
no 1
others.” 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
struck 1
his 1
hand 1
against 1
his 1
knee 1
with 1
an 1
impatient 1
gesture. 1
“if 1
i 1
had 1
only 1
been 1
there!” 1
he 1
cried. 1
“it 1
is 1
evidently 1
a 1
case 1
of 1
extraordinary 1
interest, 1
and 1
one 1
which 1
presented 1
immense 1
opportunities 1
to 1
the 1
scientific 1
expert. 1
that 1
gravel 1
page 1
upon 1
which 1
i 1
might 1
have 1
read 1
so 1
much 1
has 1
been 1
long 1
ere 1
this 1
smudged 1
by 1
the 1
rain 1
and 1
defaced 1
by 1
the 1
clogs 1
of 1
curious 1
peasants. 1
oh, 1
dr. 1
mortimer, 1
dr. 1
mortimer, 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
you 1
should 1
not 1
have 1
called 1
me 1
in! 1
you 1
have 1
indeed 1
much 1
to 1
answer 1
for.” 1
“i 1
could 1
not 1
call 1
you 1
in, 1
mr. 1
holmes, 1
without 1
disclosing 1
these 1
facts 1
to 1
the 1
world, 1
and 1
i 1
have 1
already 1
given 1
my 1
reasons 1
for 1
not 1
wishing 1
to 1
do 1
so. 1
besides, 1
besides—” 1
“why 1
do 1
you 1
hesitate?” 1
“there 1
is 1
a 1
realm 1
in 1
which 1
the 1
most 1
acute 1
and 1
most 1
experienced 1
of 1
detectives 1
is 1
helpless.” 1
“you 1
mean 1
that 1
the 1
thing 1
is 1
supernatural?” 1
“i 1
did 1
not 1
positively 1
say 1
so.” 1
“no, 1
but 1
you 1
evidently 1
think 1
it.” 1
“since 1
the 1
tragedy, 1
mr. 1
holmes, 1
there 1
have 1
come 1
to 1
my 1
ears 1
several 1
incidents 1
which 1
are 1
hard 1
to 1
reconcile 1
with 1
the 1
settled 1
order 1
of 1
nature.” 1
“for 1
example?” 1
“i 1
find 1
that 1
before 1
the 1
terrible 1
event 1
occurred 1
several 1
people 1
had 1
seen 1
a 1
creature 1
upon 1
the 1
moor 1
which 1
corresponds 1
with 1
this 1
baskerville 1
demon, 1
and 1
which 1
could 1
not 1
possibly 1
be 1
any 1
animal 1
known 1
to 1
science. 1
they 1
all 1
agreed 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
huge 1
creature, 1
luminous, 1
ghastly, 1
and 1
spectral. 1
i 1
have 1
cross-examined 1
these 1
men, 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
a 1
hard-headed 1
countryman, 1
one 1
a 1
farrier, 1
and 1
one 1
a 1
moorland 1
farmer, 1
who 1
all 1
tell 1
the 1
same 1
story 1
of 1
this 1
dreadful 1
apparition, 1
exactly 1
corresponding 1
to 1
the 1
hell-hound 1
of 1
the 1
legend. 1
i 1
assure 1
you 1
that 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
reign 1
of 1
terror 1
in 1
the 1
district, 1
and 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
hardy 1
man 1
who 1
will 1
cross 1
the 1
moor 1
at 1
night.” 1
“and 1
you, 1
a 1
trained 1
man 1
of 1
science, 1
believe 1
it 1
to 1
be 1
supernatural?” 1
“i 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
what 1
to 1
believe.” 1
holmes 1
shrugged 1
his 1
shoulders. 1
“i 1
have 1
hitherto 1
confined 1
my 1
investigations 1
to 1
this 1
world,” 1
said 1
he. 1
“in 1
a 1
modest 1
way 1
i 1
have 1
combated 1
evil, 1
but 1
to 1
take 1
on 1
the 1
father 1
of 1
evil 1
himself 1
would, 1
perhaps, 1
be 1
too 1
ambitious 1
a 1
task. 1
yet 1
you 1
must 1
admit 1
that 1
the 1
footmark 1
is 1
material.” 1
“the 1
original 1
hound 1
was 1
material 1
enough 1
to 1
tug 1
a 1
man’s 1
throat 1
out, 1
and 1
yet 1
he 1
was 1
diabolical 1
as 1
well.” 1
“i 1
see 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
quite 1
gone 1
over 1
to 1
the 1
supernaturalists. 1
but 1
now, 1
dr. 1
mortimer, 1
tell 1
me 1
this. 1
if 1
you 1
hold 1
these 1
views, 1
why 1
have 1
you 1
come 1
to 1
consult 1
me 1
at 1
all? 1
you 1
tell 1
me 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
breath 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
useless 1
to 1
investigate 1
sir 1
charles’s 1
death, 1
and 1
that 1
you 1
desire 1
me 1
to 1
do 1
it.” 1
“i 1
did 1
not 1
say 1
that 1
i 1
desired 1
you 1
to 1
do 1
it.” 1
“then, 1
how 1
can 1
i 1
assist 1
you?” 1
“by 1
advising 1
me 1
as 1
to 1
what 1
i 1
should 1
do 1
with 1
sir 1
henry 1
baskerville, 1
who 1
arrives 1
at 1
waterloo 1
station”—dr. 1
mortimer 1
looked 1
at 1
his 1
watch—“in 1
exactly 1
one 1
hour 1
and 1
a 1
quarter.” 1
“he 1
being 1
the 1
heir?” 1
“yes. 1
on 1
the 1
death 1
of 1
sir 1
charles 1
we 1
inquired 1
for 1
this 1
young 1
gentleman 1
and 1
found 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
farming 1
in 1
canada. 1
from 1
the 1
accounts 1
which 1
have 1
reached 1
us 1
he 1
is 1
an 1
excellent 1
fellow 1
in 1
every 1
way. 1
i 1
speak 1
now 1
not 1
as 1
a 1
medical 1
man 1
but 1
as 1
a 1
trustee 1
and 1
executor 1
of 1
sir 1
charles’s 1
will.” 1
“there 1
is 1
no 1
other 1
claimant, 1
i 1
presume?” 1
“none. 1
the 1
only 1
other 1
kinsman 1
whom 1
we 1
have 1
been 1
able 1
to 1
trace 1
was 1
rodger 1
baskerville, 1
the 1
youngest 1
of 1
three 1
brothers 1
of 1
whom 1
poor 1
sir 1
charles 1
was 1
the 1
elder. 1
the 1
second 1
brother, 1
who 1
died 1
young, 1
is 1
the 1
father 1
of 1
this 1
lad 1
henry. 1
the 1
third, 1
rodger, 1
was 1
the 1
black 1
sheep 1
of 1
the 1
family. 1
he 1
came 1
of 1
the 1
old 1
masterful 1
baskerville 1
strain 1
and 1
was 1
the 1
very 1
image, 1
they 1
tell 1
me, 1
of 1
the 1
family 1
picture 1
of 1
old 1
hugo. 1
he 1
made 1
england 1
too 1
hot 1
to 1
hold 1
him, 1
fled 1
to 1
central 1
america, 1
and 1
died 1
there 1
in 1
1876 1
of 1
yellow 1
fever. 1
henry 1
is 1
the 1
last 1
of 1
the 1
baskervilles. 1
in 1
one 1
hour 1
and 1
five 1
minutes 1
i 1
meet 1
him 1
at 1
waterloo 1
station. 1
i 1
have 1
had 1
a 1
wire 1
that 1
he 1
arrived 1
at 1
southampton 1
this 1
morning. 1
now, 1
mr. 1
holmes, 1
what 1
would 1
you 1
advise 1
me 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
him?” 1
“why 1
should 1
he 1
not 1
go 1
to 1
the 1
home 1
of 1
his 1
fathers?” 1
“it 1
seems 1
natural, 1
does 1
it 1
not? 1
and 1
yet, 1
consider 1
that 1
every 1
baskerville 1
who 1
goes 1
there 1
meets 1
with 1
an 1
evil 1
fate. 1
i 1
feel 1
sure 1
that 1
if 1
sir 1
charles 1
could 1
have 1
spoken 1
with 1
me 1
before 1
his 1
death 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
warned 1
me 1
against 1
bringing 1
this, 1
the 1
last 1
of 1
the 1
old 1
race, 1
and 1
the 1
heir 1
to 1
great 1
wealth, 1
to 1
that 1
deadly 1
place. 1
and 1
yet 1
it 1
cannot 1
be 1
denied 1
that 1
the 1
prosperity 1
of 1
the 1
whole 1
poor, 1
bleak 1
countryside 1
depends 1
upon 1
his 1
presence. 1
all 1
the 1
good 1
work 1
which 1
has 1
been 1
done 1
by 1
sir 1
charles 1
will 1
crash 1
to 1
the 1
ground 1
if 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
tenant 1
of 1
the 1
hall. 1
i 1
fear 1
lest 1
i 1
should 1
be 1
swayed 1
too 1
much 1
by 1
my 1
own 1
obvious 1
interest 1
in 1
the 1
matter, 1
and 1
that 1
is 1
why 1
i 1
bring 1
the 1
case 1
before 1
you 1
and 1
ask 1
for 1
your 1
advice.” 1
holmes 1
considered 1
for 1
a 1
little 1
time. 1
“put 1
into 1
plain 1
words, 1
the 1
matter 1
is 1
this,” 1
said 1
he. 1
“in 1
your 1
opinion 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
diabolical 1
agency 1
which 1
makes 1
dartmoor 1
an 1
unsafe 1
abode 1
for 1
a 1
baskerville—that 1
is 1
your 1
opinion?” 1
“at 1
least 1
i 1
might 1
go 1
the 1
length 1
of 1
saying 1
that 1
there 1
is 1
some 1
evidence 1
that 1
this 1
may 1
be 1
so.” 1
“exactly. 1
but 1
surely, 1
if 1
your 1
supernatural 1
theory 1
be 1
correct, 1
it 1
could 1
work 1
the 1
young 1
man 1
evil 1
in 1
london 1
as 1
easily 1
as 1
in 1
devonshire. 1
a 1
devil 1
with 1
merely 1
local 1
powers 1
like 1
a 1
parish 1
vestry 1
would 1
be 1
too 1
inconceivable 1
a 1
thing.” 1
“you 1
put 1
the 1
matter 1
more 1
flippantly, 1
mr. 1
holmes, 1
than 1
you 1
would 1
probably 1
do 1
if 1
you 1
were 1
brought 1
into 1
personal 1
contact 1
with 1
these 1
things. 1
your 1
advice, 1
then, 1
as 1
i 1
understand 1
it, 1
is 1
that 1
the 1
young 1
man 1
will 1
be 1
as 1
safe 1
in 1
devonshire 1
as 1
in 1
london. 1
he 1
comes 1
in 1
fifty 1
minutes. 1
what 1
would 1
you 1
recommend?” 1
“i 1
recommend, 1
sir, 1
that 1
you 1
take 1
a 1
cab, 1
call 1
off 1
your 1
spaniel 1
who 1
is 1
scratching 1
at 1
my 1
front 1
door, 1
and 1
proceed 1
to 1
waterloo 1
to 1
meet 1
sir 1
henry 1
baskerville.” 1
“and 1
then?” 1
“and 1
then 1
you 1
will 1
say 1
nothing 1
to 1
him 1
at 1
all 1
until 1
i 1
have 1
made 1
up 1
my 1
mind 1
about 1
the 1
matter.” 1
“how 1
long 1
will 1
it 1
take 1
you 1
to 1
make 1
up 1
your 1
mind?” 1
“twenty-four 1
hours. 1
at 1
ten 1
o’clock 1
tomorrow, 1
dr. 1
mortimer, 1
i 1
will 1
be 1
much 1
obliged 1
to 1
you 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
call 1
upon 1
me 1
here, 1
and 1
it 1
will 1
be 1
of 1
help 1
to 1
me 1
in 1
my 1
plans 1
for 1
the 1
future 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
bring 1
sir 1
henry 1
baskerville 1
with 1
you.” 1
“i 1
will 1
do 1
so, 1
mr. 1
holmes.” 1
he 1
scribbled 1
the 1
appointment 1
on 1
his 1
shirt-cuff 1
and 1
hurried 1
off 1
in 1
his 1
strange, 1
peering, 1
absent-minded 1
fashion. 1
holmes 1
stopped 1
him 1
at 1
the 1
head 1
of 1
the 1
stair. 1
“only 1
one 1
more 1
question, 1
dr. 1
mortimer. 1
you 1
say 1
that 1
before 1
sir 1
charles 1
baskerville’s 1
death 1
several 1
people 1
saw 1
this 1
apparition 1
upon 1
the 1
moor?” 1
“three 1
people 1
did.” 1
“did 1
any 1
see 1
it 1
after?” 1
“i 1
have 1
not 1
heard 1
of 1
any.” 1
“thank 1
you. 1
good-morning.” 1
holmes 1
returned 1
to 1
his 1
seat 1
with 1
that 1
quiet 1
look 1
of 1
inward 1
satisfaction 1
which 1
meant 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
congenial 1
task 1
before 1
him. 1
“going 1
out, 1
watson?” 1
“unless 1
i 1
can 1
help 1
you.” 1
“no, 1
my 1
dear 1
fellow, 1
it 1
is 1
at 1
the 1
hour 1
of 1
action 1
that 1
i 1
turn 1
to 1
you 1
for 1
aid. 1
but 1
this 1
is 1
splendid, 1
really 1
unique 1
from 1
some 1
points 1
of 1
view. 1
when 1
you 1
pass 1
bradley’s, 1
would 1
you 1
ask 1
him 1
to 1
send 1
up 1
a 1
pound 1
of 1
the 1
strongest 1
shag 1
tobacco? 1
thank 1
you. 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
as 1
well 1
if 1
you 1
could 1
make 1
it 1
convenient 1
not 1
to 1
return 1
before 1
evening. 1
then 1
i 1
should 1
be 1
very 1
glad 1
to 1
compare 1
impressions 1
as 1
to 1
this 1
most 1
interesting 1
problem 1
which 1
has 1
been 1
submitted 1
to 1
us 1
this 1
morning.” 1
i 1
knew 1
that 1
seclusion 1
and 1
solitude 1
were 1
very 1
necessary 1
for 1
my 1
friend 1
in 1
those 1
hours 1
of 1
intense 1
mental 1
concentration 1
during 1
which 1
he 1
weighed 1
every 1
particle 1
of 1
evidence, 1
constructed 1
alternative 1
theories, 1
balanced 1
one 1
against 1
the 1
other, 1
and 1
made 1
up 1
his 1
mind 1
as 1
to 1
which 1
points 1
were 1
essential 1
and 1
which 1
immaterial. 1
i 1
therefore 1
spent 1
the 1
day 1
at 1
my 1
club 1
and 1
did 1
not 1
return 1
to 1
baker 1
street 1
until 1
evening. 1
it 1
was 1
nearly 1
nine 1
o’clock 1
when 1
i 1
found 1
myself 1
in 1
the 1
sitting-room 1
once 1
more. 1
my 1
first 1
impression 1
as 1
i 1
opened 1
the 1
door 1
was 1
that 1
a 1
fire 1
had 1
broken 1
out, 1
for 1
the 1
room 1
was 1
so 1
filled 1
with 1
smoke 1
that 1
the 1
light 1
of 1
the 1
lamp 1
upon 1
the 1
table 1
was 1
blurred 1
by 1
it. 1
as 1
i 1
entered, 1
however, 1
my 1
fears 1
were 1
set 1
at 1
rest, 1
for 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
acrid 1
fumes 1
of 1
strong 1
coarse 1
tobacco 1
which 1
took 1
me 1
by 1
the 1
throat 1
and 1
set 1
me 1
coughing. 1
through 1
the 1
haze 1
i 1
had 1
a 1
vague 1
vision 1
of 1
holmes 1
in 1
his 1
dressing-gown 1
coiled 1
up 1
in 1
an 1
armchair 1
with 1
his 1
black 1
clay 1
pipe 1
between 1
his 1
lips. 1
several 1
rolls 1
of 1
paper 1
lay 1
around 1
him. 1
“caught 1
cold, 1
watson?” 1
said 1
he. 1
“no, 1
it’s 1
this 1
poisonous 1
atmosphere.” 1
“i 1
suppose 1
it 1
_is_ 1
pretty 1
thick, 1
now 1
that 1
you 1
mention 1
it.” 1
“thick! 1
it 1
is 1
intolerable.” 1
“open 1
the 1
window, 1
then! 1
you 1
have 1
been 1
at 1
your 1
club 1
all 1
day, 1
i 1
perceive.” 1
“my 1
dear 1
holmes!” 1
“am 1
i 1
right?” 1
“certainly, 1
but 1
how?” 1
he 1
laughed 1
at 1
my 1
bewildered 1
expression. 1
“there 1
is 1
a 1
delightful 1
freshness 1
about 1
you, 1
watson, 1
which 1
makes 1
it 1
a 1
pleasure 1
to 1
exercise 1
any 1
small 1
powers 1
which 1
i 1
possess 1
at 1
your 1
expense. 1
a 1
gentleman 1
goes 1
forth 1
on 1
a 1
showery 1
and 1
miry 1
day. 1
he 1
returns 1
immaculate 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
with 1
the 1
gloss 1
still 1
on 1
his 1
hat 1
and 1
his 1
boots. 1
he 1
has 1
been 1
a 1
fixture 1
therefore 1
all 1
day. 1
he 1
is 1
not 1
a 1
man 1
with 1
intimate 1
friends. 1
where, 1
then, 1
could 1
he 1
have 1
been? 1
is 1
it 1
not 1
obvious?” 1
“well, 1
it 1
is 1
rather 1
obvious.” 1
“the 1
world 1
is 1
full 1
of 1
obvious 1
things 1
which 1
nobody 1
by 1
any 1
chance 1
ever 1
observes. 1
where 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
been?” 1
“a 1
fixture 1
also.” 1
“on 1
the 1
contrary, 1
i 1
have 1
been 1
to 1
devonshire.” 1
“in 1
spirit?” 1
“exactly. 1
my 1
body 1
has 1
remained 1
in 1
this 1
armchair 1
and 1
has, 1
i 1
regret 1
to 1
observe, 1
consumed 1
in 1
my 1
absence 1
two 1
large 1
pots 1
of 1
coffee 1
and 1
an 1
incredible 1
amount 1
of 1
tobacco. 1
after 1
you 1
left 1
i 1
sent 1
down 1
to 1
stamford’s 1
for 1
the 1
ordnance 1
map 1
of 1
this 1
portion 1
of 1
the 1
moor, 1
and 1
my 1
spirit 1
has 1
hovered 1
over 1
it 1
all 1
day. 1
i 1
flatter 1
myself 1
that 1
i 1
could 1
find 1
my 1
way 1
about.” 1
“a 1
large-scale 1
map, 1
i 1
presume?” 1
“very 1
large.” 1
he 1
unrolled 1
one 1
section 1
and 1
held 1
it 1
over 1
his 1
knee. 1
“here 1
you 1
have 1
the 1
particular 1
district 1
which 1
concerns 1
us. 1
that 1
is 1
baskerville 1
hall 1
in 1
the 1
middle.” 1
“with 1
a 1
wood 1
round 1
it?” 1
“exactly. 1
i 1
fancy 1
the 1
yew 1
alley, 1
though 1
not 1
marked 1
under 1
that 1
name, 1
must 1
stretch 1
along 1
this 1
line, 1
with 1
the 1
moor, 1
as 1
you 1
perceive, 1
upon 1
the 1
right 1
of 1
it. 1
this 1
small 1
clump 1
of 1
buildings 1
here 1
is 1
the 1
hamlet 1
of 1
grimpen, 1
where 1
our 1
friend 1
dr. 1
mortimer 1
has 1
his 1
headquarters. 1
within 1
a 1
radius 1
of 1
five 1
miles 1
there 1
are, 1
as 1
you 1
see, 1
only 1
a 1
very 1
few 1
scattered 1
dwellings. 1
here 1
is 1
lafter 1
hall, 1
which 1
was 1
mentioned 1
in 1
the 1
narrative. 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
house 1
indicated 1
here 1
which 1
may 1
be 1
the 1
residence 1
of 1
the 1
naturalist—stapleton, 1
if 1
i 1
remember 1
right, 1
was 1
his 1
name. 1
here 1
are 1
two 1
moorland 1
farmhouses, 1
high 1
tor 1
and 1
foulmire. 1
then 1
fourteen 1
miles 1
away 1
the 1
great 1
convict 1
prison 1
of 1
princetown. 1
between 1
and 1
around 1
these 1
scattered 1
points 1
extends 1
the 1
desolate, 1
lifeless 1
moor. 1
this, 1
then, 1
is 1
the 1
stage 1
upon 1
which 1
tragedy 1
has 1
been 1
played, 1
and 1
upon 1
which 1
we 1
may 1
help 1
to 1
play 1
it 1
again.” 1
“it 1
must 1
be 1
a 1
wild 1
place.” 1
“yes, 1
the 1
setting 1
is 1
a 1
worthy 1
one. 1
if 1
the 1
devil 1
did 1
desire 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
hand 1
in 1
the 1
affairs 1
of 1
men—” 1
“then 1
you 1
are 1
yourself 1
inclining 1
to 1
the 1
supernatural 1
explanation.” 1
“the 1
devil’s 1
agents 1
may 1
be 1
of 1
flesh 1
and 1
blood, 1
may 1
they 1
not? 1
there 1
are 1
two 1
questions 1
waiting 1
for 1
us 1
at 1
the 1
outset. 1
the 1
one 1
is 1
whether 1
any 1
crime 1
has 1
been 1
committed 1
at 1
all; 1
the 1
second 1
is, 1
what 1
is 1
the 1
crime 1
and 1
how 1
was 1
it 1
committed? 1
of 1
course, 1
if 1
dr. 1
mortimer’s 1
surmise 1
should 1
be 1
correct, 1
and 1
we 1
are 1
dealing 1
with 1
forces 1
outside 1
the 1
ordinary 1
laws 1
of 1
nature, 1
there 1
is 1
an 1
end 1
of 1
our 1
investigation. 1
but 1
we 1
are 1
bound 1
to 1
exhaust 1
all 1
other 1
hypotheses 1
before 1
falling 1
back 1
upon 1
this 1
one. 1
i 1
think 1
we’ll 1
shut 1
that 1
window 1
again, 1
if 1
you 1
don’t 1
mind. 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
singular 1
thing, 1
but 1
i 1
find 1
that 1
a 1
concentrated 1
atmosphere 1
helps 1
a 1
concentration 1
of 1
thought. 1
i 1
have 1
not 1
pushed 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
length 1
of 1
getting 1
into 1
a 1
box 1
to 1
think, 1
but 1
that 1
is 1
the 1
logical 1
outcome 1
of 1
my 1
convictions. 1
have 1
you 1
turned 1
the 1
case 1
over 1
in 1
your 1
mind?” 1
“yes, 1
i 1
have 1
thought 1
a 1
good 1
deal 1
of 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
course 1
of 1
the 1
day.” 1
“what 1
do 1
you 1
make 1
of 1
it?” 1
“it 1
is 1
very 1
bewildering.” 1
“it 1
has 1
certainly 1
a 1
character 1
of 1
its 1
own. 1
there 1
are 1
points 1
of 1
distinction 1
about 1
it. 1
that 1
change 1
in 1
the 1
footprints, 1
for 1
example. 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
make 1
of 1
that?” 1
“mortimer 1
said 1
that 1
the 1
man 1
had 1
walked 1
on 1
tiptoe 1
down 1
that 1
portion 1
of 1
the 1
alley.” 1
“he 1
only 1
repeated 1
what 1
some 1
fool 1
had 1
said 1
at 1
the 1
inquest. 1
why 1
should 1
a 1
man 1
walk 1
on 1
tiptoe 1
down 1
the 1
alley?” 1
“what 1
then?” 1
“he 1
was 1
running, 1
watson—running 1
desperately, 1
running 1
for 1
his 1
life, 1
running 1
until 1
he 1
burst 1
his 1
heart—and 1
fell 1
dead 1
upon 1
his 1
face.” 1
“running 1
from 1
what?” 1
“there 1
lies 1
our 1
problem. 1
there 1
are 1
indications 1
that 1
the 1
man 1
was 1
crazed 1
with 1
fear 1
before 1
ever 1
he 1
began 1
to 1
run.” 1
“how 1
can 1
you 1
say 1
that?” 1
“i 1
am 1
presuming 1
that 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
his 1
fears 1
came 1
to 1
him 1
across 1
the 1
moor. 1
if 1
that 1
were 1
so, 1
and 1
it 1
seems 1
most 1
probable, 1
only 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
had 1
lost 1
his 1
wits 1
would 1
have 1
run 1
_from_ 1
the 1
house 1
instead 1
of 1
towards 1
it. 1
if 1
the 1
gipsy’s 1
evidence 1
may 1
be 1
taken 1
as 1
true, 1
he 1
ran 1
with 1
cries 1
for 1
help 1
in 1
the 1
direction 1
where 1
help 1
was 1
least 1
likely 1
to 1
be. 1
then, 1
again, 1
whom 1
was 1
he 1
waiting 1
for 1
that 1
night, 1
and 1
why 1
was 1
he 1
waiting 1
for 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
yew 1
alley 1
rather 1
than 1
in 1
his 1
own 1
house?” 1
“you 1
think 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
waiting 1
for 1
someone?” 1
“the 1
man 1
was 1
elderly 1
and 1
infirm. 1
we 1
can 1
understand 1
his 1
taking 1
an 1
evening 1
stroll, 1
but 1
the 1
ground 1
was 1
damp 1
and 1
the 1
night 1
inclement. 1
is 1
it 1
natural 1
that 1
he 1
should 1
stand 1
for 1
five 1
or 1
ten 1
minutes, 1
as 1
dr. 1
mortimer, 1
with 1
more 1
practical 1
sense 1
than 1
i 1
should 1
have 1
given 1
him 1
credit 1
for, 1
deduced 1
from 1
the 1
cigar 1
ash?” 1
“but 1
he 1
went 1
out 1
every 1
evening.” 1
“i 1
think 1
it 1
unlikely 1
that 1
he 1
waited 1
at 1
the 1
moor-gate 1
every 1
evening. 1
on 1
the 1
contrary, 1
the 1
evidence 1
is 1
that 1
he 1
avoided 1
the 1
moor. 1
that 1
night 1
he 1
waited 1
there. 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
night 1
before 1
he 1
made 1
his 1
departure 1
for 1
london. 1
the 1
thing 1
takes 1
shape, 1
watson. 1
it 1
becomes 1
coherent. 1
might 1
i 1
ask 1
you 1
to 1
hand 1
me 1
my 1
violin, 1
and 1
we 1
will 1
postpone 1
all 1
further 1
thought 1
upon 1
this 1
business 1
until 1
we 1
have 1
had 1
the 1
advantage 1
of 1
meeting 1
dr. 1
mortimer 1
and 1
sir 1
henry 1
baskerville 1
in 1
the 1
morning.” 1
chapter 1
4. 1
sir 1
henry 1
baskerville 1
our 1
breakfast 1
table 1
was 1
cleared 1
early, 1
and 1
holmes 1
waited 1
in 1
his 1
dressing-gown 1
for 1
the 1
promised 1
interview. 1
our 1
clients 1
were 1
punctual 1
to 1
their 1
appointment, 1
for 1
the 1
clock 1
had 1
just 1
struck 1
ten 1
when 1
dr. 1
mortimer 1
was 1
shown 1
up, 1
followed 1
by 1
the 1
young 1
baronet. 1
the 1
latter 1
was 1
a 1
small, 1
alert, 1
dark-eyed 1
man 1
about 1
thirty 1
years 1
of 1
age, 1
very 1
sturdily 1
built, 1
with 1
thick 1
black 1
eyebrows 1
and 1
a 1
strong, 1
pugnacious 1
face. 1
he 1
wore 1
a 1
ruddy-tinted 1
tweed 1
suit 1
and 1
had 1
the 1
weather-beaten 1
appearance 1
of 1
one 1
who 1
has 1
spent 1
most 1
of 1
his 1
time 1
in 1
the 1
open 1
air, 1
and 1
yet 1
there 1
was 1
something 1
in 1
his 1
steady 1
eye 1
and 1
the 1
quiet 1
assurance 1
of 1
his 1
bearing 1
which 1
indicated 1
the 1
gentleman. 1
“this 1
is 1
sir 1
henry 1
baskerville,” 1
said 1
dr. 1
mortimer. 1
“why, 1
yes,” 1
said 1
he, 1
“and 1
the 1
strange 1
thing 1
is, 1
mr. 1
sherlock 1
holmes, 1
that 1
if 1
my 1
friend 1
here 1
had 1
not 1
proposed 1
coming 1
round 1
to 1
you 1
this 1
morning 1
i 1
should 1
have 1
come 1
on 1
my 1
own 1
account. 1
i 1
understand 1
that 1
you 1
think 1
out 1
little 1
puzzles, 1
and 1
i’ve 1
had 1
one 1
this 1
morning 1
which 1
wants 1
more 1
thinking 1
out 1
than 1
i 1
am 1
able 1
to 1
give 1
it.” 1
“pray 1
take 1
a 1
seat, 1
sir 1
henry. 1
do 1
i 1
understand 1
you 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
yourself 1
had 1
some 1
remarkable 1
experience 1
since 1
you 1
arrived 1
in 1
london?” 1
“nothing 1
of 1
much 1
importance, 1
mr. 1
holmes. 1
only 1
a 1
joke, 1
as 1
like 1
as 1
not. 1
it 1
was 1
this 1
letter, 1
if 1
you 1
can 1
call 1
it 1
a 1
letter, 1
which 1
reached 1
me 1
this 1
morning.” 1
he 1
laid 1
an 1
envelope 1
upon 1
the 1
table, 1
and 1
we 1
all 1
bent 1
over 1
it. 1
it 1
was 1
of 1
common 1
quality, 1
greyish 1
in 1
colour. 1
the 1
address, 1
“sir 1
henry 1
baskerville, 1
northumberland 1
hotel,” 1
was 1
printed 1
in 1
rough 1
characters; 1
the 1
post-mark 1
“charing 1
cross,” 1
and 1
the 1
date 1
of 1
posting 1
the 1
preceding 1
evening. 1
“who 1
knew 1
that 1
you 1
were 1
going 1
to 1
the 1
northumberland 1
hotel?” 1
asked 1
holmes, 1
glancing 1
keenly 1
across 1
at 1
our 1
visitor. 1
“no 1
one 1
could 1
have 1
known. 1
we 1
only 1
decided 1
after 1
i 1
met 1
dr. 1
mortimer.” 1
“but 1
dr. 1
mortimer 1
was 1
no 1
doubt 1
already 1
stopping 1
there?” 1
“no, 1
i 1
had 1
been 1
staying 1
with 1
a 1
friend,” 1
said 1
the 1
doctor. 1
“there 1
was 1
no 1
possible 1
indication 1
that 1
we 1
intended 1
to 1
go 1
to 1
this 1
hotel.” 1
“hum! 1
someone 1
seems 1
to 1
be 1
very 1
deeply 1
interested 1
in 1
your 1
movements.” 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
envelope 1
he 1
took 1
a 1
half-sheet 1
of 1
foolscap 1
paper 1
folded 1
into 1
four. 1
this 1
he 1
opened 1
and 1
spread 1
flat 1
upon 1
the 1
table. 1
across 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
it 1
a 1
single 1
sentence 1
had 1
been 1
formed 1
by 1
the 1
expedient 1
of 1
pasting 1
printed 1
words 1
upon 1
it. 1
it 1
ran: 1
as 1
you 1
value 1
your 1
life 1
or 1
your 1
reason 1
keep 1
away 1
from 1
the 1
moor. 1
the 1
word 1
“moor” 1
only 1
was 1
printed 1
in 1
ink. 1
“now,” 1
said 1
sir 1
henry 1
baskerville, 1
“perhaps 1
you 1
will 1
tell 1
me, 1
mr. 1
holmes, 1
what 1
in 1
thunder 1
is 1
the 1
meaning 1
of 1
that, 1
and 1
who 1
it 1
is 1
that 1
takes 1
so 1
much 1
interest 1
in 1
my 1
affairs?” 1
“what 1
do 1
you 1
make 1
of 1
it, 1
dr. 1
mortimer? 1
you 1
must 1
allow 1
that 1
there 1
is 1
nothing 1
supernatural 1
about 1
this, 1
at 1
any 1
rate?” 1
“no, 1
sir, 1
but 1
it 1
might 1
very 1
well 1
come 1
from 1
someone 1
who 1
was 1
convinced 1
that 1
the 1
business 1
is 1
supernatural.” 1
“what 1
business?” 1
asked 1
sir 1
henry 1
sharply. 1
“it 1
seems 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
all 1
you 1
gentlemen 1
know 1
a 1
great 1
deal 1
more 1
than 1
i 1
do 1
about 1
my 1
own 1
affairs.” 1
“you 1
shall 1
share 1
our 1
knowledge 1
before 1
you 1
leave 1
this 1
room, 1
sir 1
henry. 1
i 1
promise 1
you 1
that,” 1
said 1
sherlock 1
holmes. 1
“we 1
will 1
confine 1
ourselves 1
for 1
the 1
present 1
with 1
your 1
permission 1
to 1
this 1
very 1
interesting 1
document, 1
which 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
put 1
together 1
and 1
posted 1
yesterday 1
evening. 1
have 1
you 1
yesterday’s 1
_times_, 1
watson?” 1
“it 1
is 1
here 1
in 1
the 1
corner.” 1
“might 1
i 1
trouble 1
you 1
for 1
it—the 1
inside 1
page, 1
please, 1
with 1
the 1
leading 1
articles?” 1
he 1
glanced 1
swiftly 1
over 1
it, 1
running 1
his 1
eyes 1
up 1
and 1
down 1
the 1
columns. 1
“capital 1
article 1
this 1
on 1
free 1
trade. 1
permit 1
me 1
to 1
give 1
you 1
an 1
extract 1
from 1
it. 1
‘you 1
may 1
be 1
cajoled 1
into 1
imagining 1
that 1
your 1
own 1
special 1
trade 1
or 1
your 1
own 1
industry 1
will 1
be 1
encouraged 1
by 1
a 1
protective 1
tariff, 1
but 1
it 1
stands 1
to 1
reason 1
that 1
such 1
legislation 1
must 1
in 1
the 1
long 1
run 1
keep 1
away 1
wealth 1
from 1
the 1
country, 1
diminish 1
the 1
value 1
of 1
our 1
imports, 1
and 1
lower 1
the 1
general 1
conditions 1
of 1
life 1
in 1
this 1
island.’ 1
“what 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
of 1
that, 1
watson?” 1
cried 1
holmes 1
in 1
high 1
glee, 1
rubbing 1
his 1
hands 1
together 1
with 1
satisfaction. 1
“don’t 1
you 1
think 1
that 1
is 1
an 1
admirable 1
sentiment?” 1
dr. 1
mortimer 1
looked 1
at 1
holmes 1
with 1
an 1
air 1
of 1
professional 1
interest, 1
and 1
sir 1
henry 1
baskerville 1
turned 1
a 1
pair 1
of 1
puzzled 1
dark 1
eyes 1
upon 1
me. 1
“i 1
don’t 1
know 1
much 1
about 1
the 1
tariff 1
and 1
things 1
of 1
that 1
kind,” 1
said 1
he, 1
“but 1
it 1
seems 1
to 1
me 1
we’ve 1
got 1
a 1
bit 1
off 1
the 1
trail 1
so 1
far 1
as 1
that 1
note 1
is 1
concerned.” 1
“on 1
the 1
contrary, 1
i 1
think 1
we 1
are 1
particularly 1
hot 1
upon 1
the 1
trail, 1
sir 1
henry. 1
watson 1
here 1
knows 1
more 1
about 1
my 1
methods 1
than 1
you 1
do, 1
but 1
i 1
fear 1
that 1
even 1
he 1
has 1
not 1
quite 1
grasped 1
the 1
significance 1
of 1
this 1
sentence.” 1
“no, 1
i 1
confess 1
that 1
i 1
see 1
no 1
connection.” 1
“and 1
yet, 1
my 1
dear 1
watson, 1
there 1
is 1
so 1
very 1
close 1
a 1
connection 1
that 1
the 1
one 1
is 1
extracted 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
other. 1
‘you,’ 1
‘your,’ 1
‘your,’ 1
‘life,’ 1
‘reason,’ 1
‘value,’ 1
‘keep 1
away,’ 1
‘from 1
the.’ 1
don’t 1
you 1
see 1
now 1
whence 1
these 1
words 1
have 1
been 1
taken?” 1
“by 1
thunder, 1
you’re 1
right! 1
well, 1
if 1
that 1
isn’t 1
smart!” 1
cried 1
sir 1
henry. 1
“if 1
any 1
possible 1
doubt 1
remained 1
it 1
is 1
settled 1
by 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
‘keep 1
away’ 1
and 1
‘from 1
the’ 1
are 1
cut 1
out 1
in 1
one 1
piece.” 1
“well, 1
now—so 1
it 1
is!” 1
“really, 1
mr. 1
holmes, 1
this 1
exceeds 1
anything 1
which 1
i 1
could 1
have 1
imagined,” 1
said 1
dr. 1
mortimer, 1
gazing 1
at 1
my 1
friend 1
in 1
amazement. 1
“i 1
could 1
understand 1
anyone 1
saying 1
that 1
the 1
words 1
were 1
from 1
a 1
newspaper; 1
but 1
that 1
you 1
should 1
name 1
which, 1
and 1
add 1
that 1
it 1
came 1
from 1
the 1
leading 1
article, 1
is 1
really 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
remarkable 1
things 1
which 1
i 1
have 1
ever 1
known. 1
how 1
did 1
you 1
do 1
it?” 1
“i 1
presume, 1
doctor, 1
that 1
you 1
could 1
tell 1
the 1
skull 1
of 1
a 1
negro 1
from 1
that 1
of 1
an 1
esquimau?” 1
“most 1
certainly.” 1
“but 1
how?” 1
“because 1
that 1
is 1
my 1
special 1
hobby. 1
the 1
differences 1
are 1
obvious. 1
the 1
supra-orbital 1
crest, 1
the 1
facial 1
angle, 1
the 1
maxillary 1
curve, 1
the—” 1
“but 1
this 1
is 1
my 1
special 1
hobby, 1
and 1
the 1
differences 1
are 1
equally 1
obvious. 1
there 1
is 1
as 1
much 1
difference 1
to 1
my 1
eyes 1
between 1
the 1
leaded 1
bourgeois 1
type 1
of 1
a 1
_times_ 1
article 1
and 1
the 1
slovenly 1
print 1
of 1
an 1
evening 1
half-penny 1
paper 1
as 1
there 1
could 1
be 1
between 1
your 1
negro 1
and 1
your 1
esquimau. 1
the 1
detection 1
of 1
types 1
is 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
elementary 1
branches 1
of 1
knowledge 1
to 1
the 1
special 1
expert 1
in 1
crime, 1
though 1
i 1
confess 1
that 1
once 1
when 1
i 1
was 1
very 1
young 1
i 1
confused 1
the 1
_leeds 1
mercury_ 1
with 1
the 1
_western 1
morning 1
news_. 1
but 1
a 1
_times_ 1
leader 1
is 1
entirely 1
distinctive, 1
and 1
these 1
words 1
could 1
have 1
been 1
taken 1
from 1
nothing 1
else. 1
as 1
it 1
was 1
done 1
yesterday 1
the 1
strong 1
probability 1
was 1
that 1
we 1
should 1
find 1
the 1
words 1
in 1
yesterday’s 1
issue.” 1
“so 1
far 1
as 1
i 1
can 1
follow 1
you, 1
then, 1
mr. 1
holmes,” 1
said 1
sir 1
henry 1
baskerville, 1
“someone 1
cut 1
out 1
this 1
message 1
with 1
a 1
scissors—” 1
“nail-scissors,” 1
said 1
holmes. 1
“you 1
can 1
see 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
very 1
short-bladed 1
scissors, 1
since 1
the 1
cutter 1
had 1
to 1
take 1
two 1
snips 1
over 1
‘keep 1
away.’” 1
“that 1
is 1
so. 1
someone, 1
then, 1
cut 1
out 1
the 1
message 1
with 1
a 1
pair 1
of 1
short-bladed 1
scissors, 1
pasted 1
it 1
with 1
paste—” 1
“gum,” 1
said 1
holmes. 1
“with 1
gum 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
paper. 1
but 1
i 1
want 1
to 1
know 1
why 1
the 1
word 1
‘moor’ 1
should 1
have 1
been 1
written?” 1
“because 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
find 1
it 1
in 1
print. 1
the 1
other 1
words 1
were 1
all 1
simple 1
and 1
might 1
be 1
found 1
in 1
any 1
issue, 1
but 1
‘moor’ 1
would 1
be 1
less 1
common.” 1
“why, 1
of 1
course, 1
that 1
would 1
explain 1
it. 1
have 1
you 1
read 1
anything 1
else 1
in 1
this 1
message, 1
mr. 1
holmes?” 1
“there 1
are 1
one 1
or 1
two 1
indications, 1
and 1
yet 1
the 1
utmost 1
pains 1
have 1
been 1
taken 1
to 1
remove 1
all 1
clues. 1
the 1
address, 1
you 1
observe 1
is 1
printed 1
in 1
rough 1
characters. 1
but 1
the 1
_times_ 1
is 1
a 1
paper 1
which 1
is 1
seldom 1
found 1
in 1
any 1
hands 1
but 1
those 1
of 1
the 1
highly 1
educated. 1
we 1
may 1
take 1
it, 1
therefore, 1
that 1
the 1
letter 1
was 1
composed 1
by 1
an 1
educated 1
man 1
who 1
wished 1
to 1
pose 1
as 1
an 1
uneducated 1
one, 1
and 1
his 1
effort 1
to 1
conceal 1
his 1
own 1
writing 1
suggests 1
that 1
that 1
writing 1
might 1
be 1
known, 1
or 1
come 1
to 1
be 1
known, 1
by 1
you. 1
again, 1
you 1
will 1
observe 1
that 1
the 1
words 1
are 1
not 1
gummed 1
on 1
in 1
an 1
accurate 1
line, 1
but 1
that 1
some 1
are 1
much 1
higher 1
than 1
others. 1
‘life,’ 1
for 1
example 1
is 1
quite 1
out 1
of 1
its 1
proper 1
place. 1
that 1
may 1
point 1
to 1
carelessness 1
or 1
it 1
may 1
point 1
to 1
agitation 1
and 1
hurry 1
upon 1
the 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
cutter. 1
on 1
the 1
whole 1
i 1
incline 1
to 1
the 1
latter 1
view, 1
since 1
the 1
matter 1
was 1
evidently 1
important, 1
and 1
it 1
is 1
unlikely 1
that 1
the 1
composer 1
of 1
such 1
a 1
letter 1
would 1
be 1
careless. 1
if 1
he 1
were 1
in 1
a 1
hurry 1
it 1
opens 1
up 1
the 1
interesting 1
question 1
why 1
he 1
should 1
be 1
in 1
a 1
hurry, 1
since 1
any 1
letter 1
posted 1
up 1
to 1
early 1
morning 1
would 1
reach 1
sir 1
henry 1
before 1
he 1
would 1
leave 1
his 1
hotel. 1
did 1
the 1
composer 1
fear 1
an 1
interruption—and 1
from 1
whom?” 1
“we 1
are 1
coming 1
now 1
rather 1
into 1
the 1
region 1
of 1
guesswork,” 1
said 1
dr. 1
mortimer. 1
“say, 1
rather, 1
into 1
the 1
region 1
where 1
we 1
balance 1
probabilities 1
and 1
choose 1
the 1
most 1
likely. 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
scientific 1
use 1
of 1
the 1
imagination, 1
but 1
we 1
have 1
always 1
some 1
material 1
basis 1
on 1
which 1
to 1
start 1
our 1
speculation. 1
now, 1
you 1
would 1
call 1
it 1
a 1
guess, 1
no 1
doubt, 1
but 1
i 1
am 1
almost 1
certain 1
that 1
this 1
address 1
has 1
been 1
written 1
in 1
a 1
hotel.” 1
“how 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
can 1
you 1
say 1
that?” 1
“if 1
you 1
examine 1
it 1
carefully 1
you 1
will 1
see 1
that 1
both 1
the 1
pen 1
and 1
the 1
ink 1
have 1
given 1
the 1
writer 1
trouble. 1
the 1
pen 1
has 1
spluttered 1
twice 1
in 1
a 1
single 1
word 1
and 1
has 1
run 1
dry 1
three 1
times 1
in 1
a 1
short 1
address, 1
showing 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
very 1
little 1
ink 1
in 1
the 1
bottle. 1
now, 1
a 1
private 1
pen 1
or 1
ink-bottle 1
is 1
seldom 1
allowed 1
to 1
be 1
in 1
such 1
a 1
state, 1
and 1
the 1
combination 1
of 1
the 1
two 1
must 1
be 1
quite 1
rare. 1
but 1
you 1
know 1
the 1
hotel 1
ink 1
and 1
the 1
hotel 1
pen, 1
where 1
it 1
is 1
rare 1
to 1
get 1
anything 1
else. 1
yes, 1
i 1
have 1
very 1
little 1
hesitation 1
in 1
saying 1
that 1
could 1
we 1
examine 1
the 1
waste-paper 1
baskets 1
of 1
the 1
hotels 1
around 1
charing 1
cross 1
until 1
we 1
found 1
the 1
remains 1
of 1
the 1
mutilated 1
_times_ 1
leader 1
we 1
could 1
lay 1
our 1
hands 1
straight 1
upon 1
the 1
person 1
who 1
sent 1
this 1
singular 1
message. 1
halloa! 1
halloa! 1
what’s 1
this?” 1
he 1
was 1
carefully 1
examining 1
the 1
foolscap, 1
upon 1
which 1
the 1
words 1
were 1
pasted, 1
holding 1
it 1
only 1
an 1
inch 1
or 1
two 1
from 1
his 1
eyes. 1
“well?” 1
“nothing,” 1
said 1
he, 1
throwing 1
it 1
down. 1
“it 1
is 1
a 1
blank 1
half-sheet 1
of 1
paper, 1
without 1
even 1
a 1
water-mark 1
upon 1
it. 1
i 1
think 1
we 1
have 1
drawn 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
we 1
can 1
from 1
this 1
curious 1
letter; 1
and 1
now, 1
sir 1
henry, 1
has 1
anything 1
else 1
of 1
interest 1
happened 1
to 1
you 1
since 1
you 1
have 1
been 1
in 1
london?” 1
“why, 1
no, 1
mr. 1
holmes. 1
i 1
think 1
not.” 1
“you 1
have 1
not 1
observed 1
anyone 1
follow 1
or 1
watch 1
you?” 1
“i 1
seem 1
to 1
have 1
walked 1
right 1
into 1
the 1
thick 1
of 1
a 1
dime 1
novel,” 1
said 1
our 1
visitor. 1
“why 1
in 1
thunder 1
should 1
anyone 1
follow 1
or 1
watch 1
me?” 1
“we 1
are 1
coming 1
to 1
that. 1
you 1
have 1
nothing 1
else 1
to 1
report 1
to 1
us 1
before 1
we 1
go 1
into 1
this 1
matter?” 1
“well, 1
it 1
depends 1
upon 1
what 1
you 1
think 1
worth 1
reporting.” 1
“i 1
think 1
anything 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
ordinary 1
routine 1
of 1
life 1
well 1
worth 1
reporting.” 1
sir 1
henry 1
smiled. 1
“i 1
don’t 1
know 1
much 1
of 1
british 1
life 1
yet, 1
for 1
i 1
have 1
spent 1
nearly 1
all 1
my 1
time 1
in 1
the 1
states 1
and 1
in 1
canada. 1
but 1
i 1
hope 1
that 1
to 1
lose 1
one 1
of 1
your 1
boots 1
is 1
not 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
ordinary 1
routine 1
of 1
life 1
over 1
here.” 1
“you 1
have 1
lost 1
one 1
of 1
your 1
boots?” 1
“my 1
dear 1
sir,” 1
cried 1
dr. 1
mortimer, 1
“it 1
is 1
only 1
mislaid. 1
you 1
will 1
find 1
it 1
when 1
you 1
return 1
to 1
the 1
hotel. 1
what 1
is 1
the 1
use 1
of 1
troubling 1
mr. 1
holmes 1
with 1
trifles 1
of 1
this 1
kind?” 1
“well, 1
he 1
asked 1
me 1
for 1
anything 1
outside 1
the 1
ordinary 1
routine.” 1
“exactly,” 1
said 1
holmes, 1
“however 1
foolish 1
the 1
incident 1
may 1
seem. 1
you 1
have 1
lost 1
one 1
of 1
your 1
boots, 1
you 1
say?” 1
“well, 1
mislaid 1
it, 1
anyhow. 1
i 1
put 1
them 1
both 1
outside 1
my 1
door 1
last 1
night, 1
and 1
there 1
was 1
only 1
one 1
in 1
the 1
morning. 1
i 1
could 1
get 1
no 1
sense 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
chap 1
who 1
cleans 1
them. 1
the 1
worst 1
of 1
it 1
is 1
that 1
i 1
only 1
bought 1
the 1
pair 1
last 1
night 1
in 1
the 1
strand, 1
and 1
i 1
have 1
never 1
had 1
them 1
on.” 1
“if 1
you 1
have 1
never 1
worn 1
them, 1
why 1
did 1
you 1
put 1
them 1
out 1
to 1
be 1
