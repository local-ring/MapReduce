to 1
me. 1
“well, 1

you 1

i 1
think. 1
but 1
if 1
we 1
can 1
only 1
trace 1
l. 1
l. 1
it 1
should 1
clear 1
up 1
the 1
whole 1
business. 1
we 1
have 1
gained 1
that 1
much. 1
we 1
know 1
that 1
there 1
is 1
someone 1
who 1
has 1
the 1
facts 1
if 1
we 1
can 1
only 1
find 1
her. 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
we 1
should 1
do?” 1
“let 1
holmes 1
know 1
all 1
about 1
it 1
at 1
once. 1
it 1
will 1
give 1
him 1
the 1
clue 1
for 1
which 1
he 1
has 1
been 1
seeking. 1
i 1
am 1
much 1
mistaken 1
if 1
it 1
does 1
not 1
bring 1
him 1
down.” 1
i 1
went 1
at 1
once 1
to 1
my 1
room 1
and 1
drew 1
up 1
my 1
report 1
of 1
the 1
morning’s 1
conversation 1
for 1
holmes. 1
it 1
was 1
evident 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
very 1
busy 1
of 1
late, 1
for 1
the 1
notes 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
from 1
baker 1
street 1
were 1
few 1
and 1
short, 1
with 1
no 1
comments 1
upon 1
the 1
information 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
supplied 1
and 1
hardly 1
any 1
reference 1
to 1
my 1
mission. 1
no 1
doubt 1
his 1
blackmailing 1
case 1
is 1
absorbing 1
all 1
his 1
faculties. 1
and 1
yet 1
this 1
new 1
factor 1
must 1
surely 1
arrest 1
his 1
attention 1
and 1
renew 1
his 1
interest. 1
i 1
wish 1
that 1
he 1
were 1
here. 1
_october_ 1
17_th_.—all 1
day 1
today 1
the 1
rain 1
poured 1
down, 1
rustling 1
on 1
the 1
ivy 1
and 1
dripping 1
from 1
the 1
eaves. 1
i 1
thought 1
of 1
the 1
convict 1
out 1
upon 1
the 1
bleak, 1
cold, 1
shelterless 1
moor. 1
poor 1
devil! 1
whatever 1
his 1
crimes, 1
he 1
has 1
suffered 1
something 1
to 1
atone 1
for 1
them. 1
and 1
then 1
i 1
thought 1
of 1
that 1
other 1
one—the 1
face 1
in 1
the 1
cab, 1
the 1
figure 1
against 1
the 1
moon. 1
was 1
he 1
also 1
out 1
in 1
that 1
deluged—the 1
unseen 1
watcher, 1
the 1
man 1
of 1
darkness? 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
i 1
put 1
on 1
my 1
waterproof 1
and 1
i 1
walked 1
far 1
upon 1
the 1
sodden 1
moor, 1
full 1
of 1
dark 1
imaginings, 1
the 1
rain 1
beating 1
upon 1
my 1
face 1
and 1
the 1
wind 1
whistling 1
about 1
my 1
ears. 1
