cleaned?” 1
“they 1
were 1
tan 1
boots 1
and 1
had 1
never 1
been 1
varnished. 1
that 1
was 1
why 1
i 1
put 1
them 1
out.” 1
“then 1
i 1
understand 1
that 1
on 1
your 1
arrival 1
in 1
london 1
yesterday 1
you 1
went 1
out 1
at 1
once 1
and 1
bought 1
a 1
pair 1
of 1
boots?” 1
“i 1
did 1
a 1
good 1
deal 1
of 1
shopping. 1
dr. 1
mortimer 1
here 1
went 1
round 1
with 1
me. 1
you 1
see, 1
if 1
i 1
am 1
to 1
be 1
squire 1
down 1
there 1
i 1
must 1
dress 1
the 1
part, 1
and 1
it 1
may 1
be 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
got 1
a 1
little 1
careless 1
in 1
my 1
ways 1
out 1
west. 1
among 1
other 1
things 1
i 1
bought 1
these 1
brown 1
boots—gave 1
six 1
dollars 1
for 1
them—and 1
had 1
one 1
stolen 1
before 1
ever 1
i 1
had 1
them 1
on 1
my 1
feet.” 1
“it 1
seems 1
a 1
singularly 1
useless 1
thing 1
to 1
steal,” 1
said 1
sherlock 1
holmes. 1
“i 1
confess 1
that 1
i 1
share 1
dr. 1
mortimer’s 1
belief 1
that 1
it 1
will 1
not 1
be 1
long 1
before 1
the 1
missing 1
boot 1
is 1
found.” 1
“and, 1
now, 1
gentlemen,” 1
said 1
the 1
baronet 1
with 1
decision, 1
“it 1
seems 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
i 1
have 1
spoken 1
quite 1
enough 1
about 1
the 1
little 1
that 1
i 1
know. 1
it 1
is 1
time 1
that 1
you 1
kept 1
your 1
promise 1
and 1
gave 1
me 1
a 1
full 1
account 1
of 1
what 1
we 1
are 1
all 1
driving 1
at.” 1
“your 1
request 1
is 1
a 1
very 1
reasonable 1
one,” 1
holmes 1
answered. 1
“dr. 1
mortimer, 1
i 1
think 1
you 1
could 1
not 1
do 1
better 1
than 1
to 1
tell 1
your 1
story 1
as 1
you 1
told 1
it 1
to 1
us.” 1
thus 1
encouraged, 1
our 1
scientific 1
friend 1
drew 1
his 1
papers 1
from 1
his 1
pocket 1
and 1
presented 1
the 1
whole 1
case 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
done 1
upon 1
the 1
morning 1
before. 1
sir 1
henry 1
baskerville 1
listened 1
with 1
the 1
deepest 1
attention 1
and 1
with 1
an 1
occasional 1
exclamation 1
of 1
surprise. 1
“well, 1
i 1
seem 1
to 1
have 1
come 1
into 1
an 1
inheritance 1
with 1
a 1
vengeance,” 1
said 1
he 1
when 1
the 1
long 1
narrative 1
was 1
finished. 1
“of 1
course, 1
i’ve 1
heard 1
of 1
the 1
hound 1
ever 1
since 1
i 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
nursery. 1
it’s 1
the 1
pet 1
story 1
of 1
the 1
family, 1
though 1
i 1
never 1
thought 1
of 1
taking 1
it 1
seriously 1
before. 1
but 1
as 1
to 1
my 1
uncle’s 1
death—well, 1
it 1
all 1
seems 1
boiling 1
up 1
in 1
my 1
head, 1
and 1
i 1
can’t 1
get 1
it 1
clear 1
yet. 1
you 1
don’t 1
seem 1
quite 1
to 1
have 1
made 1
up 1
your 1
mind 1
whether 1
it’s 1
a 1
case 1
for 1
a 1
policeman 1
or 1
a 1
clergyman.” 1
“precisely.” 1
“and 1
now 1
there’s 1
this 1
affair 1
of 1
the 1
letter 1
to 1
me 1
at 1
the 1
hotel. 1
i 1
suppose 1
that 1
fits 1
into 1
its 1
place.” 1
“it 1
seems 1
to 1
show 1
that 1
someone 1
knows 1
more 1
than 1
we 1
do 1
about 1
what 1
goes 1
on 1
upon 1
the 1
moor,” 1
said 1
dr. 1
mortimer. 1
“and 1
also,” 1
said 1
holmes, 1
“that 1
someone 1
is 1
not 1
ill-disposed 1
towards 1
you, 1
since 1
they 1
warn 1
you 1
of 1
danger.” 1
“or 1
it 1
may 1
be 1
that 1
they 1
wish, 1
for 1
their 1
own 1
purposes, 1
to 1
scare 1
me 1
away.” 1
“well, 1
of 1
course, 1
that 1
is 1
possible 1
also. 1
i 1
am 1
very 1
much 1
indebted 1
to 1
you, 1
dr. 1
mortimer, 1
for 1
introducing 1
me 1
to 1
a 1
problem 1
which 1
presents 1
several 1
interesting 1
alternatives. 1
but 1
the 1
practical 1
point 1
which 1
we 1
now 1
have 1
to 1
decide, 1
sir 1
henry, 1
is 1
whether 1
it 1
is 1
or 1
is 1
not 1
advisable 1
for 1
you 1
to 1
go 1
to 1
baskerville 1
hall.” 1
“why 1
should 1
i 1
not 1
go?” 1
“there 1
seems 1
to 1
be 1
danger.” 1
“do 1
you 1
mean 1
danger 1
from 1
this 1
family 1
fiend 1
or 1
do 1
you 1
mean 1
danger 1
from 1
human 1
beings?” 1
“well, 1
that 1
is 1
what 1
we 1
have 1
to 1
find 1
out.” 1
“whichever 1
it 1
is, 1
my 1
answer 1
is 1
fixed. 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
devil 1
in 1
hell, 1
mr. 1
holmes, 1
and 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
man 1
upon 1
earth 1
who 1
can 1
prevent 1
me 1
from 1
going 1
to 1
the 1
home 1
of 1
my 1
own 1
people, 1
and 1
you 1
may 1
take 1
that 1
to 1
be 1
my 1
final 1
answer.” 1
his 1
dark 1
brows 1
knitted 1
and 1
his 1
face 1
flushed 1
to 1
a 1
dusky 1
red 1
as 1
he 1
spoke. 1
it 1
was 1
evident 1
that 1
the 1
fiery 1
temper 1
of 1
the 1
baskervilles 1
was 1
not 1
extinct 1
in 1
this 1
their 1
last 1
representative. 1
“meanwhile,” 1
said 1
he, 1
“i 1
have 1
hardly 1
had 1
time 1
to 1
think 1
over 1
all 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
told 1
me. 1
it’s 1
a 1
big 1
thing 1
for 1
a 1
man 1
to 1
have 1
to 1
understand 1
and 1
to 1
decide 1
at 1
one 1
sitting. 1
i 1
should 1
like 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
quiet 1
hour 1
by 1
myself 1
to 1
make 1
up 1
my 1
mind. 1
now, 1
look 1
here, 1
mr. 1
holmes, 1
it’s 1
half-past 1
eleven 1
now 1
and 1
i 1
am 1
going 1
back 1
right 1
away 1
to 1
my 1
hotel. 1
suppose 1
you 1
and 1
your 1
friend, 1
dr. 1
watson, 1
come 1
round 1
and 1
lunch 1
with 1
us 1
at 1
two. 1
i’ll 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
tell 1
you 1
more 1
clearly 1
then 1
how 1
this 1
thing 1
strikes 1
me.” 1
“is 1
that 1
convenient 1
to 1
you, 1
watson?” 1
“perfectly.” 1
“then 1
you 1
may 1
expect 1
us. 1
shall 1
i 1
have 1
a 1
cab 1
called?” 1
“i’d 1
prefer 1
to 1
walk, 1
for 1
this 1
affair 1
has 1
flurried 1
me 1
rather.” 1
“i’ll 1
join 1
you 1
in 1
a 1
walk, 1
with 1
pleasure,” 1
said 1
his 1
companion. 1
“then 1
we 1
meet 1
again 1
at 1
two 1
o’clock. 1
au 1
revoir, 1
and 1
good-morning!” 1
we 1
heard 1
the 1
steps 1
of 1
our 1
visitors 1
descend 1
the 1
stair 1
and 1
the 1
bang 1
of 1
the 1
front 1
door. 1
in 1
an 1
instant 1
holmes 1
had 1
changed 1
from 1
the 1
languid 1
dreamer 1
to 1
the 1
man 1
of 1
action. 1
“your 1
hat 1
and 1
boots, 1
watson, 1
quick! 1
not 1
a 1
moment 1
to 1
lose!” 1
he 1
rushed 1
into 1
his 1
room 1
in 1
his 1
dressing-gown 1
and 1
was 1
back 1
again 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
seconds 1
in 1
a 1
frock-coat. 1
we 1
hurried 1
together 1
down 1
the 1
stairs 1
and 1
into 1
the 1
street. 1
dr. 1
mortimer 1
and 1
baskerville 1
were 1
still 1
visible 1
about 1
two 1
hundred 1
yards 1
ahead 1
of 1
us 1
in 1
the 1
direction 1
of 1
oxford 1
street. 1
“shall 1
i 1
run 1
on 1
and 1
stop 1
them?” 1
“not 1
for 1
the 1
world, 1
my 1
dear 1
watson. 1
i 1
am 1
perfectly 1
satisfied 1
with 1
your 1
company 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
tolerate 1
mine. 1
our 1
friends 1
are 1
wise, 1
for 1
it 1
is 1
certainly 1
a 1
very 1
fine 1
morning 1
for 1
a 1
walk.” 1
he 1
quickened 1
his 1
pace 1
until 1
we 1
had 1
decreased 1
the 1
distance 1
which 1
divided 1
us 1
by 1
about 1
half. 1
then, 1
still 1
keeping 1
a 1
hundred 1
yards 1
behind, 1
we 1
followed 1
into 1
oxford 1
street 1
and 1
so 1
down 1
regent 1
street. 1
once 1
our 1
friends 1
stopped 1
and 1
stared 1
into 1
a 1
shop 1
window, 1
upon 1
which 1
holmes 1
did 1
the 1
same. 1
an 1
instant 1
afterwards 1
he 1
gave 1
a 1
little 1
cry 1
of 1
satisfaction, 1
and, 1
following 1
the 1
direction 1
of 1
his 1
eager 1
eyes, 1
i 1
saw 1
that 1
a 1
hansom 1
cab 1
with 1
a 1
man 1
inside 1
which 1
had 1
halted 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
street 1
was 1
now 1
proceeding 1
slowly 1
onward 1
again. 1
“there’s 1
our 1
man, 1
watson! 1
come 1
along! 1
we’ll 1
have 1
a 1
good 1
look 1
at 1
him, 1
if 1
we 1
can 1
do 1
no 1
more.” 1
at 1
that 1
instant 1
i 1
was 1
aware 1
of 1
a 1
bushy 1
black 1
beard 1
and 1
a 1
pair 1
of 1
piercing 1
eyes 1
turned 1
upon 1
us 1
through 1
the 1
side 1
window 1
of 1
the 1
cab. 1
instantly 1
the 1
trapdoor 1
at 1
the 1
top 1
flew 1
up, 1
something 1
was 1
screamed 1
to 1
the 1
driver, 1
and 1
the 1
cab 1
flew 1
madly 1
off 1
down 1
regent 1
street. 1
holmes 1
looked 1
eagerly 1
round 1
for 1
another, 1
but 1
no 1
empty 1
one 1
was 1
in 1
sight. 1
then 1
he 1
dashed 1
in 1
wild 1
pursuit 1
amid 1
the 1
stream 1
of 1
the 1
traffic, 1
but 1
the 1
start 1
was 1
too 1
great, 1
and 1
already 1
the 1
cab 1
was 1
out 1
of 1
sight. 1
“there 1
now!” 1
said 1
holmes 1
bitterly 1
as 1
he 1
emerged 1
panting 1
and 1
white 1
with 1
vexation 1
from 1
the 1
tide 1
of 1
vehicles. 1
“was 1
ever 1
such 1
bad 1
luck 1
and 1
such 1
bad 1
management, 1
too? 1
watson, 1
watson, 1
if 1
you 1
are 1
an 1
honest 1
man 1
you 1
will 1
record 1
this 1
also 1
and 1
set 1
it 1
against 1
my 1
successes!” 1
“who 1
was 1
the 1
man?” 1
“i 1
have 1
not 1
an 1
idea.” 1
“a 1
spy?” 1
“well, 1
it 1
was 1
evident 1
from 1
what 1
we 1
have 1
heard 1
that 1
baskerville 1
has 1
been 1
very 1
closely 1
shadowed 1
by 1
someone 1
since 1
he 1
has 1
been 1
in 1
town. 1
how 1
else 1
could 1
it 1
be 1
known 1
so 1
quickly 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
northumberland 1
hotel 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
chosen? 1
if 1
they 1
had 1
followed 1
him 1
the 1
first 1
day 1
i 1
argued 1
that 1
they 1
would 1
follow 1
him 1
also 1
the 1
second. 1
you 1
may 1
have 1
observed 1
that 1
i 1
twice 1
strolled 1
over 1
to 1
the 1
window 1
while 1
dr. 1
mortimer 1
was 1
reading 1
his 1
legend.” 1
“yes, 1
i 1
remember.” 1
“i 1
was 1
looking 1
out 1
for 1
loiterers 1
in 1
the 1
street, 1
but 1
i 1
saw 1
none. 1
we 1
are 1
dealing 1
with 1
a 1
clever 1
man, 1
watson. 1
this 1
matter 1
cuts 1
very 1
deep, 1
and 1
though 1
i 1
have 1
not 1
finally 1
made 1
up 1
my 1
mind 1
whether 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
benevolent 1
or 1
a 1
malevolent 1
agency 1
which 1
is 1
in 1
touch 1
with 1
us, 1
i 1
am 1
conscious 1
always 1
of 1
power 1
and 1
design. 1
when 1
our 1
friends 1
left 1
i 1
at 1
once 1
followed 1
them 1
in 1
the 1
hopes 1
of 1
marking 1
down 1
their 1
invisible 1
attendant. 1
so 1
wily 1
was 1
he 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
not 1
trusted 1
himself 1
upon 1
foot, 1
but 1
he 1
had 1
availed 1
himself 1
of 1
a 1
cab 1
so 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
loiter 1
behind 1
or 1
dash 1
past 1
them 1
and 1
so 1
escape 1
their 1
notice. 1
his 1
method 1
had 1
the 1
additional 1
advantage 1
that 1
if 1
they 1
were 1
to 1
take 1
a 1
cab 1
he 1
was 1
all 1
ready 1
to 1
follow 1
them. 1
it 1
has, 1
however, 1
one 1
obvious 1
disadvantage.” 1
“it 1
puts 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
power 1
of 1
the 1
cabman.” 1
“exactly.” 1
“what 1
a 1
pity 1
we 1
did 1
not 1
get 1
the 1
number!” 1
“my 1
dear 1
watson, 1
clumsy 1
as 1
i 1
have 1
been, 1
you 1
surely 1
do 1
not 1
seriously 1
imagine 1
that 1
i 1
neglected 1
to 1
get 1
the 1
number? 1
no. 1
2704 1
is 1
our 1
man. 1
but 1
that 1
is 1
no 1
use 1
to 1
us 1
for 1
the 1
moment.” 1
“i 1
fail 1
to 1
see 1
how 1
you 1
could 1
have 1
done 1
more.” 1
“on 1
observing 1
the 1
cab 1
i 1
should 1
have 1
instantly 1
turned 1
and 1
walked 1
in 1
the 1
other 1
direction. 1
i 1
should 1
then 1
at 1
my 1
leisure 1
have 1
hired 1
a 1
second 1
cab 1
and 1
followed 1
the 1
first 1
at 1
a 1
respectful 1
distance, 1
or, 1
better 1
still, 1
have 1
driven 1
to 1
the 1
northumberland 1
hotel 1
and 1
waited 1
there. 1
when 1
our 1
unknown 1
had 1
followed 1
baskerville 1
home 1
we 1
should 1
have 1
had 1
the 1
opportunity 1
of 1
playing 1
his 1
own 1
game 1
upon 1
himself 1
and 1
seeing 1
where 1
he 1
made 1
for. 1
as 1
it 1
is, 1
by 1
an 1
indiscreet 1
eagerness, 1
which 1
was 1
taken 1
advantage 1
of 1
with 1
extraordinary 1
quickness 1
and 1
energy 1
by 1
our 1
opponent, 1
we 1
have 1
betrayed 1
ourselves 1
and 1
lost 1
our 1
man.” 1
we 1
had 1
been 1
sauntering 1
slowly 1
down 1
regent 1
street 1
during 1
this 1
conversation, 1
and 1
dr. 1
mortimer, 1
with 1
his 1
companion, 1
had 1
long 1
vanished 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
us. 1
“there 1
is 1
no 1
object 1
in 1
our 1
following 1
them,” 1
said 1
holmes. 1
“the 1
shadow 1
has 1
departed 1
and 1
will 1
not 1
return. 1
we 1
must 1
see 1
what 1
further 1
cards 1
we 1
have 1
in 1
our 1
hands 1
and 1
play 1
them 1
with 1
decision. 1
could 1
you 1
swear 1
to 1
that 1
man’s 1
face 1
within 1
the 1
cab?” 1
“i 1
could 1
swear 1
only 1
to 1
the 1
beard.” 1
“and 1
so 1
could 1
i—from 1
which 1
i 1
gather 1
that 1
in 1
all 1
probability 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
false 1
one. 1
a 1
clever 1
man 1
upon 1
so 1
delicate 1
an 1
errand 1
has 1
no 1
use 1
for 1
a 1
beard 1
save 1
to 1
conceal 1
his 1
features. 1
come 1
in 1
here, 1
watson!” 1
he 1
turned 1
into 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
district 1
messenger 1
offices, 1
where 1
he 1
was 1
warmly 1
greeted 1
by 1
the 1
manager. 1
“ah, 1
wilson, 1
i 1
see 1
you 1
have 1
not 1
forgotten 1
the 1
little 1
case 1
in 1
which 1
i 1
had 1
the 1
good 1
fortune 1
to 1
help 1
you?” 1
“no, 1
sir, 1
indeed 1
i 1
have 1
not. 1
you 1
saved 1
my 1
good 1
name, 1
and 1
perhaps 1
my 1
life.” 1
“my 1
dear 1
fellow, 1
you 1
exaggerate. 1
i 1
have 1
some 1
recollection, 1
wilson, 1
that 1
you 1
had 1
among 1
your 1
boys 1
a 1
lad 1
named 1
cartwright, 1
who 1
showed 1
some 1
ability 1
during 1
the 1
investigation.” 1
“yes, 1
sir, 1
he 1
is 1
still 1
with 1
us.” 1
“could 1
you 1
ring 1
him 1
up?—thank 1
you! 1
and 1
i 1
should 1
be 1
glad 1
to 1
have 1
change 1
of 1
this 1
five-pound 1
note.” 1
a 1
lad 1
of 1
fourteen, 1
with 1
a 1
bright, 1
keen 1
face, 1
had 1
obeyed 1
the 1
summons 1
of 1
the 1
manager. 1
he 1
stood 1
now 1
gazing 1
with 1
great 1
reverence 1
at 1
the 1
famous 1
detective. 1
“let 1
me 1
have 1
the 1
hotel 1
directory,” 1
said 1
holmes. 1
“thank 1
you! 1
now, 1
cartwright, 1
there 1
are 1
the 1
names 1
of 1
twenty-three 1
hotels 1
here, 1
all 1
in 1
the 1
immediate 1
neighbourhood 1
of 1
charing 1
cross. 1
do 1
you 1
see?” 1
“yes, 1
sir.” 1
“you 1
will 1
visit 1
each 1
of 1
these 1
in 1
turn.” 1
“yes, 1
sir.” 1
“you 1
will 1
begin 1
in 1
each 1
case 1
by 1
giving 1
the 1
outside 1
porter 1
one 1
shilling. 1
here 1
are 1
twenty-three 1
shillings.” 1
“yes, 1
sir.” 1
“you 1
will 1
tell 1
him 1
that 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
waste-paper 1
of 1
yesterday. 1
you 1
will 1
say 1
that 1
an 1
important 1
telegram 1
has 1
miscarried 1
and 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
looking 1
for 1
it. 1
you 1
understand?” 1
“yes, 1
sir.” 1
“but 1
what 1
you 1
are 1
really 1
looking 1
for 1
is 1
the 1
centre 1
page 1
of 1
the 1
_times_ 1
with 1
some 1
holes 1
cut 1
in 1
it 1
with 1
scissors. 1
here 1
is 1
a 1
copy 1
of 1
the 1
_times_. 1
it 1
is 1
this 1
page. 1
you 1
could 1
easily 1
recognize 1
it, 1
could 1
you 1
not?” 1
“yes, 1
sir.” 1
“in 1
each 1
case 1
the 1
outside 1
porter 1
will 1
send 1
for 1
the 1
hall 1
porter, 1
to 1
whom 1
also 1
you 1
will 1
give 1
a 1
shilling. 1
here 1
are 1
twenty-three 1
shillings. 1
you 1
will 1
then 1
learn 1
in 1
possibly 1
twenty 1
cases 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
twenty-three 1
that 1
the 1
waste 1
of 1
the 1
day 1
before 1
has 1
been 1
burned 1
or 1
removed. 1
in 1
the 1
three 1
other 1
cases 1
you 1
will 1
be 1
shown 1
a 1
heap 1
of 1
paper 1
and 1
you 1
will 1
look 1
for 1
this 1
page 1
of 1
the 1
_times_ 1
among 1
it. 1
the 1
odds 1
are 1
enormously 1
against 1
your 1
finding 1
it. 1
there 1
are 1
ten 1
shillings 1
over 1
in 1
case 1
of 1
emergencies. 1
let 1
me 1
have 1
a 1
report 1
by 1
wire 1
at 1
baker 1
street 1
before 1
evening. 1
and 1
now, 1
watson, 1
it 1
only 1
remains 1
for 1
us 1
to 1
find 1
out 1
by 1
wire 1
the 1
identity 1
of 1
the 1
cabman, 1
no. 1
2704, 1
and 1
then 1
we 1
will 1
drop 1
into 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
bond 1
street 1
picture 1
galleries 1
and 1
fill 1
in 1
the 1
time 1
until 1
we 1
are 1
due 1
at 1
the 1
hotel.” 1
chapter 1
5. 1
three 1
broken 1
threads 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
had, 1
in 1
a 1
very 1
remarkable 1
degree, 1
the 1
power 1
of 1
detaching 1
his 1
mind 1
at 1
will. 1
for 1
two 1
hours 1
the 1
strange 1
business 1
in 1
which 1
we 1
had 1
been 1
involved 1
appeared 1
to 1
be 1
forgotten, 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
entirely 1
absorbed 1
in 1
the 1
pictures 1
of 1
the 1
modern 1
belgian 1
masters. 1
he 1
would 1
talk 1
of 1
nothing 1
but 1
art, 1
of 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
the 1
crudest 1
ideas, 1
from 1
our 1
leaving 1
the 1
gallery 1
until 1
we 1
found 1
ourselves 1
at 1
the 1
northumberland 1
hotel. 1
“sir 1
henry 1
baskerville 1
is 1
upstairs 1
expecting 1
you,” 1
said 1
the 1
clerk. 1
“he 1
asked 1
me 1
to 1
show 1
you 1
up 1
at 1
once 1
when 1
you 1
came.” 1
“have 1
you 1
any 1
objection 1
to 1
my 1
looking 1
at 1
your 1
register?” 1
said 1
holmes. 1
“not 1
in 1
the 1
least.” 1
the 1
book 1
showed 1
that 1
two 1
names 1
had 1
been 1
added 1
after 1
that 1
of 1
baskerville. 1
one 1
was 1
theophilus 1
johnson 1
and 1
family, 1
of 1
newcastle; 1
the 1
other 1
mrs. 1
oldmore 1
and 1
maid, 1
of 1
high 1
lodge, 1
alton. 1
“surely 1
that 1
must 1
be 1
the 1
same 1
johnson 1
whom 1
i 1
used 1
to 1
know,” 1
said 1
holmes 1
to 1
the 1
porter. 1
“a 1
lawyer, 1
is 1
he 1
not, 1
grey-headed, 1
and 1
walks 1
with 1
a 1
limp?” 1
“no, 1
sir, 1
this 1
is 1
mr. 1
johnson, 1
the 1
coal-owner, 1
a 1
very 1
active 1
gentleman, 1
not 1
older 1
than 1
yourself.” 1
“surely 1
you 1
are 1
mistaken 1
about 1
his 1
trade?” 1
“no, 1
sir! 1
he 1
has 1
used 1
this 1
hotel 1
for 1
many 1
years, 1
and 1
he 1
is 1
very 1
well 1
known 1
to 1
us.” 1
“ah, 1
that 1
settles 1
it. 1
mrs. 1
oldmore, 1
too; 1
i 1
seem 1
to 1
remember 1
the 1
name. 1
excuse 1
my 1
curiosity, 1
but 1
often 1
in 1
calling 1
upon 1
one 1
friend 1
one 1
finds 1
another.” 1
“she 1
is 1
an 1
invalid 1
lady, 1
sir. 1
her 1
husband 1
was 1
once 1
mayor 1
of 1
gloucester. 1
she 1
always 1
comes 1
to 1
us 1
when 1
she 1
is 1
in 1
town.” 1
“thank 1
you; 1
i 1
am 1
afraid 1
i 1
cannot 1
claim 1
her 1
acquaintance. 1
we 1
have 1
established 1
a 1
most 1
important 1
fact 1
by 1
these 1
questions, 1
watson,” 1
he 1
continued 1
in 1
a 1
low 1
voice 1
as 1
we 1
went 1
upstairs 1
together. 1
“we 1
know 1
now 1
that 1
the 1
people 1
who 1
are 1
so 1
interested 1
in 1
our 1
friend 1
have 1
not 1
settled 1
down 1
in 1
his 1
own 1
hotel. 1
that 1
means 1
that 1
while 1
they 1
are, 1
as 1
we 1
have 1
seen, 1
very 1
anxious 1
to 1
watch 1
him, 1
they 1
are 1
equally 1
anxious 1
that 1
he 1
should 1
not 1
see 1
them. 1
now, 1
this 1
is 1
a 1
most 1
suggestive 1
fact.” 1
“what 1
does 1
it 1
suggest?” 1
“it 1
suggests—halloa, 1
my 1
dear 1
fellow, 1
what 1
on 1
earth 1
is 1
the 1
matter?” 1
as 1
we 1
came 1
round 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
the 1
stairs 1
we 1
had 1
run 1
up 1
against 1
sir 1
henry 1
baskerville 1
himself. 1
his 1
face 1
was 1
flushed 1
with 1
anger, 1
and 1
he 1
held 1
an 1
old 1
and 1
dusty 1
boot 1
in 1
one 1
of 1
his 1
hands. 1
so 1
furious 1
was 1
he 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
hardly 1
articulate, 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
did 1
speak 1
it 1
was 1
in 1
a 1
much 1
broader 1
and 1
more 1
western 1
dialect 1
than 1
any 1
which 1
we 1
had 1
heard 1
from 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
morning. 1
“seems 1
to 1
me 1
they 1
are 1
playing 1
me 1
for 1
a 1
sucker 1
in 1
this 1
hotel,” 1
he 1
cried. 1
“they’ll 1
find 1
they’ve 1
started 1
in 1
to 1
monkey 1
with 1
the 1
wrong 1
man 1
unless 1
they 1
are 1
careful. 1
by 1
thunder, 1
if 1
that 1
chap 1
can’t 1
find 1
my 1
missing 1
boot 1
there 1
will 1
be 1
trouble. 1
i 1
can 1
take 1
a 1
joke 1
with 1
the 1
best, 1
mr. 1
holmes, 1
but 1
they’ve 1
got 1
a 1
bit 1
over 1
the 1
mark 1
this 1
time.” 1
“still 1
looking 1
for 1
your 1
boot?” 1
“yes, 1
sir, 1
and 1
mean 1
to 1
find 1
it.” 1
“but, 1
surely, 1
you 1
said 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
new 1
brown 1
boot?” 1
“so 1
it 1
was, 1
sir. 1
and 1
now 1
it’s 1
an 1
old 1
black 1
one.” 1
“what! 1
you 1
don’t 1
mean 1
to 1
say—?” 1
“that’s 1
just 1
what 1
i 1
do 1
mean 1
to 1
say. 1
i 1
only 1
had 1
three 1
pairs 1
in 1
the 1
world—the 1
new 1
brown, 1
the 1
old 1
black, 1
and 1
the 1
patent 1
leathers, 1
which 1
i 1
am 1
wearing. 1
last 1
night 1
they 1
took 1
one 1
of 1
my 1
brown 1
ones, 1
and 1
today 1
they 1
have 1
sneaked 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
black. 1
well, 1
have 1
you 1
got 1
it? 1
speak 1
out, 1
man, 1
and 1
don’t 1
stand 1
staring!” 1
an 1
agitated 1
german 1
waiter 1
had 1
appeared 1
upon 1
the 1
scene. 1
“no, 1
sir; 1
i 1
have 1
made 1
inquiry 1
all 1
over 1
the 1
hotel, 1
but 1
i 1
can 1
hear 1
no 1
word 1
of 1
it.” 1
“well, 1
either 1
that 1
boot 1
comes 1
back 1
before 1
sundown 1
or 1
i’ll 1
see 1
the 1
manager 1
and 1
tell 1
him 1
that 1
i 1
go 1
right 1
straight 1
out 1
of 1
this 1
hotel.” 1
“it 1
shall 1
be 1
found, 1
sir—i 1
promise 1
you 1
that 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
have 1
a 1
little 1
patience 1
it 1
will 1
be 1
found.” 1
“mind 1
it 1
is, 1
for 1
it’s 1
the 1
last 1
thing 1
of 1
mine 1
that 1
i’ll 1
lose 1
in 1
this 1
den 1
of 1
thieves. 1
well, 1
well, 1
mr. 1
holmes, 1
you’ll 1
excuse 1
my 1
troubling 1
you 1
about 1
such 1
a 1
trifle—” 1
“i 1
think 1
it’s 1
well 1
worth 1
troubling 1
about.” 1
“why, 1
you 1
look 1
very 1
serious 1
over 1
it.” 1
“how 1
do 1
you 1
explain 1
it?” 1
“i 1
just 1
don’t 1
attempt 1
to 1
explain 1
it. 1
it 1
seems 1
the 1
very 1
maddest, 1
queerest 1
thing 1
that 1
ever 1
happened 1
to 1
me.” 1
“the 1
queerest 1
perhaps—” 1
said 1
holmes 1
thoughtfully. 1
“what 1
do 1
you 1
make 1
of 1
it 1
yourself?” 1
“well, 1
i 1
don’t 1
profess 1
to 1
understand 1
it 1
yet. 1
this 1
case 1
of 1
yours 1
is 1
very 1
complex, 1
sir 1
henry. 1
when 1
taken 1
in 1
conjunction 1
with 1
your 1
uncle’s 1
death 1
i 1
am 1
not 1
sure 1
that 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
five 1
hundred 1
cases 1
of 1
capital 1
importance 1
which 1
i 1
have 1
handled 1
there 1
is 1
one 1
which 1
cuts 1
so 1
deep. 1
but 1
we 1
hold 1
several 1
threads 1
in 1
our 1
hands, 1
and 1
the 1
odds 1
are 1
that 1
one 1
or 1
other 1
of 1
them 1
guides 1
us 1
to 1
the 1
truth. 1
we 1
may 1
waste 1
time 1
in 1
following 1
the 1
wrong 1
one, 1
but 1
sooner 1
or 1
later 1
we 1
must 1
come 1
upon 1
the 1
right.” 1
we 1
had 1
a 1
pleasant 1
luncheon 1
in 1
which 1
little 1
was 1
said 1
of 1
the 1
business 1
which 1
had 1
brought 1
us 1
together. 1
it 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
private 1
sitting-room 1
to 1
which 1
we 1
afterwards 1
repaired 1
that 1
holmes 1
asked 1
baskerville 1
what 1
were 1
his 1
intentions. 1
“to 1
go 1
to 1
baskerville 1
hall.” 1
“and 1
when?” 1
“at 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
week.” 1
“on 1
the 1
whole,” 1
said 1
holmes, 1
“i 1
think 1
that 1
your 1
decision 1
is 1
a 1
wise 1
one. 1
i 1
have 1
ample 1
evidence 1
that 1
you 1
are 1
being 1
dogged 1
in 1
london, 1
and 1
amid 1
the 1
millions 1
of 1
this 1
great 1
city 1
it 1
is 1
difficult 1
to 1
discover 1
who 1
these 1
people 1
are 1
or 1
what 1
their 1
object 1
can 1
be. 1
if 1
their 1
intentions 1
are 1
evil 1
they 1
might 1
do 1
you 1
a 1
mischief, 1
and 1
we 1
should 1
be 1
powerless 1
to 1
prevent 1
it. 1
you 1
did 1
not 1
know, 1
dr. 1
mortimer, 1
that 1
you 1
were 1
followed 1
this 1
morning 1
from 1
my 1
house?” 1
dr. 1
mortimer 1
started 1
violently. 1
“followed! 1
by 1
whom?” 1
“that, 1
unfortunately, 1
is 1
what 1
i 1
cannot 1
tell 1
you. 1
have 1
you 1
among 1
your 1
neighbours 1
or 1
acquaintances 1
on 1
dartmoor 1
any 1
man 1
with 1
a 1
black, 1
full 1
beard?” 1
“no—or, 1
let 1
me 1
see—why, 1
yes. 1
barrymore, 1
sir 1
charles’s 1
butler, 1
is 1
a 1
man 1
with 1
a 1
full, 1
black 1
beard.” 1
“ha! 1
where 1
is 1
barrymore?” 1
“he 1
is 1
in 1
charge 1
of 1
the 1
hall.” 1
“we 1
had 1
best 1
ascertain 1
if 1
he 1
is 1
really 1
there, 1
or 1
if 1
by 1
any 1
possibility 1
he 1
might 1
be 1
in 1
london.” 1
“how 1
can 1
you 1
do 1
that?” 1
“give 1
me 1
a 1
telegraph 1
form. 1
‘is 1
all 1
ready 1
for 1
sir 1
henry?’ 1
that 1
will 1
do. 1
address 1
to 1
mr. 1
barrymore, 1
baskerville 1
hall. 1
what 1
is 1
the 1
nearest 1
telegraph-office? 1
grimpen. 1
very 1
good, 1
we 1
will 1
send 1
a 1
second 1
wire 1
to 1
the 1
postmaster, 1
grimpen: 1
‘telegram 1
to 1
mr. 1
barrymore 1
to 1
be 1
delivered 1
into 1
his 1
own 1
hand. 1
if 1
absent, 1
please 1
return 1
wire 1
to 1
sir 1
henry 1
baskerville, 1
northumberland 1
hotel.’ 1
that 1
should 1
let 1
us 1
know 1
before 1
evening 1
whether 1
barrymore 1
is 1
at 1
his 1
post 1
in 1
devonshire 1
or 1
not.” 1
“that’s 1
so,” 1
said 1
baskerville. 1
“by 1
the 1
way, 1
dr. 1
mortimer, 1
who 1
is 1
this 1
barrymore, 1
anyhow?” 1
“he 1
is 1
the 1
son 1
of 1
the 1
old 1
caretaker, 1
who 1
is 1
dead. 1
they 1
have 1
looked 1
after 1
the 1
hall 1
for 1
four 1
generations 1
now. 1
so 1
far 1
as 1
i 1
know, 1
he 1
and 1
his 1
wife 1
are 1
as 1
respectable 1
a 1
couple 1
as 1
any 1
in 1
the 1
county.” 1
“at 1
the 1
same 1
time,” 1
said 1
baskerville, 1
“it’s 1
clear 1
enough 1
that 1
so 1
long 1
as 1
there 1
are 1
none 1
of 1
the 1
family 1
at 1
the 1
hall 1
these 1
people 1
have 1
a 1
mighty 1
fine 1
home 1
and 1
nothing 1
to 1
do.” 1
“that 1
is 1
true.” 1
“did 1
barrymore 1
profit 1
at 1
all 1
by 1
sir 1
charles’s 1
will?” 1
asked 1
holmes. 1
“he 1
and 1
his 1
wife 1
had 1
five 1
hundred 1
pounds 1
each.” 1
“ha! 1
did 1
they 1
know 1
that 1
they 1
would 1
receive 1
this?” 1
“yes; 1
sir 1
charles 1
was 1
very 1
fond 1
of 1
talking 1
about 1
the 1
provisions 1
of 1
his 1
will.” 1
“that 1
is 1
very 1
interesting.” 1
“i 1
hope,” 1
said 1
dr. 1
mortimer, 1
“that 1
you 1
do 1
not 1
look 1
with 1
suspicious 1
eyes 1
upon 1
everyone 1
who 1
received 1
a 1
legacy 1
from 1
sir 1
charles, 1
for 1
i 1
also 1
had 1
a 1
thousand 1
pounds 1
left 1
to 1
me.” 1
“indeed! 1
and 1
anyone 1
else?” 1
“there 1
were 1
many 1
insignificant 1
sums 1
to 1
individuals, 1
and 1
a 1
large 1
number 1
of 1
public 1
charities. 1
the 1
residue 1
all 1
went 1
to 1
sir 1
henry.” 1
“and 1
how 1
much 1
was 1
the 1
residue?” 1
“seven 1
hundred 1
and 1
forty 1
thousand 1
pounds.” 1
holmes 1
raised 1
his 1
eyebrows 1
in 1
surprise. 1
“i 1
had 1
no 1
idea 1
that 1
so 1
gigantic 1
a 1
sum 1
was 1
involved,” 1
said 1
he. 1
“sir 1
charles 1
had 1
the 1
reputation 1
of 1
being 1
rich, 1
but 1
we 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
how 1
very 1
rich 1
he 1
was 1
until 1
we 1
came 1
to 1
examine 1
his 1
securities. 1
the 1
total 1
value 1
of 1
the 1
estate 1
was 1
close 1
on 1
to 1
a 1
million.” 1
“dear 1
me! 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
stake 1
for 1
which 1
a 1
man 1
might 1
well 1
play 1
a 1
desperate 1
game. 1
and 1
one 1
more 1
question, 1
dr. 1
mortimer. 1
supposing 1
that 1
anything 1
happened 1
to 1
our 1
young 1
friend 1
here—you 1
will 1
forgive 1
the 1
unpleasant 1
hypothesis!—who 1
would 1
inherit 1
the 1
estate?” 1
“since 1
rodger 1
baskerville, 1
sir 1
charles’s 1
younger 1
brother 1
died 1
unmarried, 1
the 1
estate 1
would 1
descend 1
to 1
the 1
desmonds, 1
who 1
are 1
distant 1
cousins. 1
james 1
desmond 1
is 1
an 1
elderly 1
clergyman 1
in 1
westmoreland.” 1
“thank 1
you. 1
these 1
details 1
are 1
all 1
of 1
great 1
interest. 1
have 1
you 1
met 1
mr. 1
james 1
desmond?” 1
“yes; 1
he 1
once 1
came 1
down 1
to 1
visit 1
sir 1
charles. 1
he 1
is 1
a 1
man 1
of 1
venerable 1
appearance 1
and 1
of 1
saintly 1
life. 1
i 1
remember 1
that 1
he 1
refused 1
to 1
accept 1
any 1
settlement 1
from 1
sir 1
charles, 1
though 1
he 1
pressed 1
it 1
upon 1
him.” 1
“and 1
this 1
man 1
of 1
simple 1
tastes 1
would 1
be 1
the 1
heir 1
to 1
sir 1
charles’s 1
thousands.” 1
“he 1
would 1
be 1
the 1
heir 1
to 1
the 1
estate 1
because 1
that 1
is 1
entailed. 1
he 1
would 1
also 1
be 1
the 1
heir 1
to 1
the 1
money 1
unless 1
it 1
were 1
willed 1
otherwise 1
by 1
the 1
present 1
owner, 1
who 1
can, 1
of 1
course, 1
do 1
what 1
he 1
likes 1
with 1
it.” 1
“and 1
have 1
you 1
made 1
your 1
will, 1
sir 1
henry?” 1
“no, 1
mr. 1
holmes, 1
i 1
have 1
not. 1
i’ve 1
had 1
no 1
time, 1
for 1
it 1
was 1
only 1
yesterday 1
that 1
i 1
learned 1
how 1
matters 1
stood. 1
but 1
in 1
any 1
case 1
i 1
feel 1
that 1
the 1
money 1
should 1
go 1
with 1
the 1
title 1
and 1
estate. 1
that 1
was 1
my 1
poor 1
uncle’s 1
idea. 1
how 1
is 1
the 1
owner 1
going 1
to 1
restore 1
the 1
glories 1
of 1
the 1
baskervilles 1
if 1
he 1
has 1
not 1
money 1
enough 1
to 1
keep 1
up 1
the 1
property? 1
house, 1
land, 1
and 1
dollars 1
must 1
go 1
together.” 1
“quite 1
so. 1
well, 1
sir 1
henry, 1
i 1
am 1
of 1
one 1
mind 1
with 1
you 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
advisability 1
of 1
your 1
going 1
down 1
to 1
devonshire 1
without 1
delay. 1
there 1
is 1
only 1
one 1
provision 1
which 1
i 1
must 1
make. 1
you 1
certainly 1
must 1
not 1
go 1
alone.” 1
“dr. 1
mortimer 1
returns 1
with 1
me.” 1
“but 1
dr. 1
mortimer 1
has 1
his 1
practice 1
to 1
attend 1
to, 1
and 1
his 1
house 1
is 1
miles 1
away 1
from 1
yours. 1
with 1
all 1
the 1
goodwill 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
he 1
may 1
be 1
unable 1
to 1
help 1
you. 1
no, 1
sir 1
henry, 1
you 1
must 1
take 1
with 1
you 1
someone, 1
a 1
trusty 1
man, 1
who 1
will 1
be 1
always 1
by 1
your 1
side.” 1
“is 1
it 1
possible 1
that 1
you 1
could 1
come 1
yourself, 1
mr. 1
holmes?” 1
“if 1
matters 1
came 1
to 1
a 1
crisis 1
i 1
should 1
endeavour 1
to 1
be 1
present 1
in 1
person; 1
but 1
you 1
can 1
understand 1
that, 1
with 1
my 1
extensive 1
consulting 1
practice 1
and 1
with 1
the 1
constant 1
appeals 1
which 1
reach 1
me 1
from 1
many 1
quarters, 1
it 1
is 1
impossible 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
be 1
absent 1
from 1
london 1
for 1
an 1
indefinite 1
time. 1
at 1
the 1
present 1
instant 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
revered 1
names 1
in 1
england 1
is 1
being 1
besmirched 1
by 1
a 1
blackmailer, 1
and 1
only 1
i 1
can 1
stop 1
a 1
disastrous 1
scandal. 1
you 1
will 1
see 1
how 1
impossible 1
it 1
is 1
for 1
me 1
to 1
go 1
to 1
dartmoor.” 1
“whom 1
would 1
you 1
recommend, 1
then?” 1
holmes 1
laid 1
his 1
hand 1
upon 1
my 1
arm. 1
“if 1
my 1
friend 1
would 1
undertake 1
it 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
man 1
who 1
is 1
better 1
worth 1
having 1
at 1
your 1
side 1
when 1
you 1
are 1
in 1
a 1
tight 1
place. 1
no 1
one 1
can 1
say 1
so 1
more 1
confidently 1
than 1
i.” 1
the 1
proposition 1
took 1
me 1
completely 1
by 1
surprise, 1
but 1
before 1
i 1
had 1
time 1
to 1
answer, 1
baskerville 1
seized 1
me 1
by 1
the 1
hand 1
and 1
wrung 1
it 1
heartily. 1
“well, 1
now, 1
that 1
is 1
real 1
kind 1
of 1
you, 1
dr. 1
watson,” 1
said 1
he. 1
“you 1
see 1
how 1
it 1
is 1
with 1
me, 1
and 1
you 1
know 1
just 1
as 1
much 1
about 1
the 1
matter 1
as 1
i 1
do. 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
come 1
down 1
to 1
baskerville 1
hall 1
and 1
see 1
me 1
through 1
i’ll 1
never 1
forget 1
it.” 1
the 1
promise 1
of 1
adventure 1
had 1
always 1
a 1
fascination 1
for 1
me, 1
and 1
i 1
was 1
complimented 1
by 1
the 1
words 1
of 1
holmes 1
and 1
by 1
the 1
eagerness 1
with 1
which 1
the 1
baronet 1
hailed 1
me 1
as 1
a 1
companion. 1
“i 1
will 1
come, 1
with 1
pleasure,” 1
said 1
i. 1
“i 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
how 1
i 1
could 1
employ 1
my 1
time 1
better.” 1
“and 1
you 1
will 1
report 1
very 1
carefully 1
to 1
me,” 1
said 1
holmes. 1
“when 1
a 1
crisis 1
comes, 1
as 1
it 1
will 1
do, 1
i 1
will 1
direct 1
how 1
you 1
shall 1
act. 1
i 1
suppose 1
that 1
by 1
saturday 1
all 1
might 1
be 1
ready?” 1
“would 1
that 1
suit 1
dr. 1
watson?” 1
“perfectly.” 1
“then 1
on 1
saturday, 1
unless 1
you 1
hear 1
to 1
the 1
contrary, 1
we 1
shall 1
meet 1
at 1
the 1
ten-thirty 1
train 1
from 1
paddington.” 1
we 1
had 1
risen 1
to 1
depart 1
when 1
baskerville 1
gave 1
a 1
cry 1
of 1
triumph, 1
and 1
diving 1
into 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
corners 1
of 1
the 1
room 1
he 1
drew 1
a 1
brown 1
boot 1
from 1
under 1
a 1
cabinet. 1
“my 1
missing 1
boot!” 1
he 1
cried. 1
“may 1
all 1
our 1
difficulties 1
vanish 1
as 1
easily!” 1
said 1
sherlock 1
holmes. 1
“but 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
very 1
singular 1
thing,” 1
dr. 1
mortimer 1
remarked. 1
“i 1
searched 1
this 1
room 1
carefully 1
before 1
lunch.” 1
“and 1
so 1
did 1
i,” 1
said 1
baskerville. 1
“every 1
inch 1
of 1
it.” 1
“there 1
was 1
certainly 1
no 1
boot 1
in 1
it 1
then.” 1
“in 1
that 1
case 1
the 1
waiter 1
must 1
have 1
placed 1
it 1
there 1
while 1
we 1
were 1
lunching.” 1
the 1
german 1
was 1
sent 1
for 1
but 1
professed 1
to 1
know 1
nothing 1
of 1
the 1
matter, 1
nor 1
could 1
any 1
inquiry 1
clear 1
it 1
up. 1
another 1
item 1
had 1
been 1
added 1
to 1
that 1
constant 1
and 1
apparently 1
purposeless 1
series 1
of 1
small 1
mysteries 1
which 1
had 1
succeeded 1
each 1
other 1
so 1
rapidly. 1
setting 1
aside 1
the 1
whole 1
grim 1
story 1
of 1
sir 1
charles’s 1
death, 1
we 1
had 1
a 1
line 1
of 1
inexplicable 1
incidents 1
all 1
within 1
the 1
limits 1
of 1
two 1
days, 1
which 1
included 1
the 1
receipt 1
of 1
the 1
printed 1
letter, 1
the 1
black-bearded 1
spy 1
in 1
the 1
hansom, 1
the 1
loss 1
of 1
the 1
new 1
brown 1
boot, 1
the 1
loss 1
of 1
the 1
old 1
black 1
boot, 1
and 1
now 1
the 1
return 1
of 1
the 1
new 1
brown 1
boot. 1
holmes 1
sat 1
in 1
silence 1
in 1
the 1
cab 1
as 1
we 1
drove 1
back 1
to 1
baker 1
street, 1
and 1
i 1
knew 1
from 1
his 1
drawn 1
brows 1
and 1
keen 1
face 1
that 1
his 1
mind, 1
like 1
my 1
own, 1
was 1
busy 1
in 1
endeavouring 1
to 1
frame 1
some 1
scheme 1
into 1
which 1
all 1
these 1
strange 1
and 1
apparently 1
disconnected 1
episodes 1
could 1
be 1
fitted. 1
all 1
afternoon 1
and 1
late 1
into 1
the 1
evening 1
he 1
sat 1
lost 1
in 1
tobacco 1
and 1
thought. 1
just 1
before 1
dinner 1
two 1
telegrams 1
were 1
handed 1
in. 1
the 1
first 1
ran: 1
have 1
just 1
heard 1
that 1
barrymore 1
is 1
at 1
the 1
hall. 1
baskerville. 1
the 1
second: 1
visited 1
twenty-three 1
hotels 1
as 1
directed, 1
but 1
sorry 1
to 1
report 1
unable 1
to 1
trace 1
cut 1
sheet 1
of 1
_times_. 1
cartwright. 1
“there 1
go 1
two 1
of 1
my 1
threads, 1
watson. 1
there 1
is 1
nothing 1
more 1
stimulating 1
than 1
a 1
case 1
where 1
everything 1
goes 1
against 1
you. 1
we 1
must 1
cast 1
round 1
for 1
another 1
scent.” 1
“we 1
have 1
still 1
the 1
cabman 1
who 1
drove 1
the 1
spy.” 1
“exactly. 1
i 1
have 1
wired 1
to 1
get 1
his 1
name 1
and 1
address 1
from 1
the 1
official 1
registry. 1
i 1
should 1
not 1
be 1
surprised 1
if 1
this 1
were 1
an 1
answer 1
to 1
my 1
question.” 1
the 1
ring 1
at 1
the 1
bell 1
proved 1
to 1
be 1
something 1
even 1
more 1
satisfactory 1
than 1
an 1
answer, 1
however, 1
for 1
the 1
door 1
opened 1
and 1
a 1
rough-looking 1
fellow 1
entered 1
who 1
was 1
evidently 1
the 1
man 1
himself. 1
“i 1
got 1
a 1
message 1
from 1
the 1
head 1
office 1
that 1
a 1
gent 1
at 1
this 1
address 1
had 1
been 1
inquiring 1
for 1
no. 1
2704,” 1
said 1
he. 1
“i’ve 1
driven 1
my 1
cab 1
this 1
seven 1
years 1
and 1
never 1
a 1
word 1
of 1
complaint. 1
i 1
came 1
here 1
straight 1
from 1
the 1
yard 1
to 1
ask 1
you 1
to 1
your 1
face 1
what 1
you 1
had 1
against 1
me.” 1
“i 1
have 1
nothing 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
against 1
you, 1
my 1
good 1
man,” 1
said 1
holmes. 1
“on 1
the 1
contrary, 1
i 1
have 1
half 1
a 1
sovereign 1
for 1
you 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
give 1
me 1
a 1
clear 1
answer 1
to 1
my 1
questions.” 1
“well, 1
i’ve 1
had 1
a 1
good 1
day 1
and 1
no 1
mistake,” 1
said 1
the 1
cabman 1
with 1
a 1
grin. 1
“what 1
was 1
it 1
you 1
wanted 1
to 1
ask, 1
sir?” 1
“first 1
of 1
all 1
your 1
name 1
and 1
address, 1
in 1
case 1
i 1
want 1
you 1
again.” 1
“john 1
clayton, 1
3 1
turpey 1
street, 1
the 1
borough. 1
my 1
cab 1
is 1
out 1
of 1
shipley’s 1
yard, 1
near 1
waterloo 1
station.” 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
made 1
a 1
note 1
of 1
it. 1
“now, 1
clayton, 1
tell 1
me 1
all 1
about 1
the 1
fare 1
who 1
came 1
and 1
watched 1
this 1
house 1
at 1
ten 1
o’clock 1
this 1
morning 1
and 1
afterwards 1
followed 1
the 1
two 1
gentlemen 1
down 1
regent 1
street.” 1
the 1
man 1
looked 1
surprised 1
and 1
a 1
little 1
embarrassed. 1
“why, 1
there’s 1
no 1
good 1
my 1
telling 1
you 1
things, 1
for 1
you 1
seem 1
to 1
know 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
i 1
do 1
already,” 1
said 1
he. 1
“the 1
truth 1
is 1
that 1
the 1
gentleman 1
told 1
me 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
detective 1
and 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
to 1
say 1
nothing 1
about 1
him 1
to 1
anyone.” 1
“my 1
good 1
fellow; 1
this 1
is 1
a 1
very 1
serious 1
business, 1
and 1
you 1
may 1
find 1
yourself 1
in 1
a 1
pretty 1
bad 1
position 1
if 1
you 1
try 1
to 1
hide 1
anything 1
from 1
me. 1
you 1
say 1
that 1
your 1
fare 1
told 1
you 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
detective?” 1
“yes, 1
he 1
did.” 1
“when 1
did 1
he 1
say 1
this?” 1
“when 1
he 1
left 1
me.” 1
“did 1
he 1
say 1
anything 1
more?” 1
“he 1
mentioned 1
his 1
name.” 1
holmes 1
cast 1
a 1
swift 1
glance 1
of 1
triumph 1
at 1
me. 1
“oh, 1
he 1
mentioned 1
his 1
name, 1
did 1
he? 1
that 1
was 1
imprudent. 1
what 1
was 1
the 1
name 1
that 1
he 1
mentioned?” 1
“his 1
name,” 1
said 1
the 1
cabman, 1
“was 1
mr. 1
sherlock 1
holmes.” 1
never 1
have 1
i 1
seen 1
my 1
friend 1
more 1
completely 1
taken 1
aback 1
than 1
by 1
the 1
cabman’s 1
reply. 1
for 1
an 1
instant 1
he 1
sat 1
in 1
silent 1
amazement. 1
then 1
he 1
burst 1
into 1
a 1
hearty 1
laugh. 1
“a 1
touch, 1
watson—an 1
undeniable 1
touch!” 1
said 1
he. 1
“i 1
feel 1
a 1
foil 1
as 1
quick 1
and 1
supple 1
as 1
my 1
own. 1
he 1
got 1
home 1
upon 1
me 1
very 1
prettily 1
that 1
time. 1
so 1
his 1
name 1
was 1
sherlock 1
holmes, 1
was 1
it?” 1
“yes, 1
sir, 1
that 1
was 1
the 1
gentleman’s 1
name.” 1
“excellent! 1
tell 1
me 1
where 1
you 1
picked 1
him 1
up 1
and 1
all 1
that 1
occurred.” 1
“he 1
hailed 1
me 1
at 1
half-past 1
nine 1
in 1
trafalgar 1
square. 1
he 1
said 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
detective, 1
and 1
he 1
offered 1
me 1
two 1
guineas 1
if 1
i 1
would 1
do 1
exactly 1
what 1
he 1
wanted 1
all 1
day 1
and 1
ask 1
no 1
questions. 1
i 1
was 1
glad 1
enough 1
to 1
agree. 1
first 1
we 1
drove 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
northumberland 1
hotel 1
and 1
waited 1
there 1
until 1
two 1
gentlemen 1
came 1
out 1
and 1
took 1
a 1
cab 1
from 1
the 1
rank. 1
we 1
followed 1
their 1
cab 1
until 1
it 1
pulled 1
up 1
somewhere 1
near 1
here.” 1
“this 1
very 1
door,” 1
said 1
holmes. 1
“well, 1
i 1
couldn’t 1
be 1
sure 1
of 1
that, 1
but 1
i 1
dare 1
say 1
my 1
fare 1
knew 1
all 1
about 1
it. 1
we 1
pulled 1
up 1
halfway 1
down 1
the 1
street 1
and 1
waited 1
an 1
hour 1
and 1
a 1
half. 1
then 1
the 1
two 1
gentlemen 1
passed 1
us, 1
walking, 1
and 1
we 1
followed 1
down 1
baker 1
street 1
and 1
along—” 1
“i 1
know,” 1
said 1
holmes. 1
“until 1
we 1
got 1
three-quarters 1
down 1
regent 1
street. 1
then 1
my 1
gentleman 1
threw 1
up 1
the 1
trap, 1
and 1
he 1
cried 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
drive 1
right 1
away 1
to 1
waterloo 1
station 1
as 1
hard 1
as 1
i 1
could 1
go. 1
i 1
whipped 1
up 1
the 1
mare 1
and 1
we 1
were 1
there 1
under 1
the 1
ten 1
minutes. 1
then 1
he 1
paid 1
up 1
his 1
two 1
guineas, 1
like 1
a 1
good 1
one, 1
and 1
away 1
he 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
station. 1
only 1
just 1
as 1
he 1
was 1
leaving 1
he 1
turned 1
round 1
and 1
he 1
said: 1
‘it 1
might 1
interest 1
you 1
to 1
know 1
that 1
you 1
have 1
been 1
driving 1
mr. 1
sherlock 1
holmes.’ 1
that’s 1
how 1
i 1
come 1
to 1
know 1
the 1
name.” 1
“i 1
see. 1
and 1
you 1
saw 1
no 1
more 1
of 1
him?” 1
“not 1
after 1
he 1
went 1
into 1
the 1
station.” 1
“and 1
how 1
would 1
you 1
describe 1
mr. 1
sherlock 1
holmes?” 1
the 1
cabman 1
scratched 1
his 1
head. 1
“well, 1
he 1
wasn’t 1
altogether 1
such 1
an 1
easy 1
gentleman 1
to 1
describe. 1
i’d 1
put 1
him 1
at 1
forty 1
years 1
of 1
age, 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
of 1
a 1
middle 1
height, 1
two 1
or 1
three 1
inches 1
shorter 1
than 1
you, 1
sir. 1
he 1
was 1
dressed 1
like 1
a 1
toff, 1
and 1
he 1
had 1
a 1
black 1
beard, 1
cut 1
square 1
at 1
the 1
end, 1
and 1
a 1
pale 1
face. 1
i 1
don’t 1
know 1
as 1
i 1
could 1
say 1
more 1
than 1
that.” 1
“colour 1
of 1
his 1
eyes?” 1
“no, 1
i 1
can’t 1
say 1
that.” 1
“nothing 1
more 1
that 1
you 1
can 1
remember?” 1
“no, 1
sir; 1
nothing.” 1
“well, 1
then, 1
here 1
is 1
your 1
half-sovereign. 1
there’s 1
another 1
one 1
waiting 1
for 1
you 1
if 1
you 1
can 1
bring 1
any 1
more 1
information. 1
good-night!” 1
“good-night, 1
sir, 1
and 1
thank 1
you!” 1
john 1
clayton 1
departed 1
chuckling, 1
and 1
holmes 1
turned 1
to 1
me 1
with 1
a 1
shrug 1
of 1
his 1
shoulders 1
and 1
a 1
rueful 1
smile. 1
“snap 1
goes 1
our 1
third 1
thread, 1
and 1
we 1
end 1
where 1
we 1
began,” 1
said 1
he. 1
“the 1
cunning 1
rascal! 1
he 1
knew 1
our 1
number, 1
knew 1
that 1
sir 1
henry 1
baskerville 1
had 1
consulted 1
me, 1
spotted 1
who 1
i 1
was 1
in 1
regent 1
street, 1
conjectured 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
got 1
the 1
number 1
of 1
the 1
cab 1
and 1
would 1
lay 1
my 1
hands 1
on 1
the 1
driver, 1
and 1
so 1
sent 1
back 1
this 1
audacious 1
message. 1
i 1
tell 1
you, 1
watson, 1
this 1
time 1
we 1
have 1
got 1
a 1
foeman 1
who 1
is 1
worthy 1
of 1
our 1
steel. 1
i’ve 1
been 1
checkmated 1
in 1
london. 1
i 1
can 1
only 1
wish 1
you 1
better 1
luck 1
in 1
devonshire. 1
but 1
i’m 1
not 1
easy 1
in 1
my 1
mind 1
about 1
it.” 1
“about 1
what?” 1
“about 1
sending 1
you. 1
it’s 1
an 1
ugly 1
business, 1
watson, 1
an 1
ugly 1
dangerous 1
business, 1
and 1
the 1
more 1
i 1
see 1
of 1
it 1
the 1
less 1
i 1
like 1
it. 1
yes, 1
my 1
dear 1
fellow, 1
you 1
may 1
laugh, 1
but 1
i 1
give 1
you 1
my 1
word 1
that 1
i 1
shall 1
be 1
very 1
glad 1
to 1
have 1
you 1
back 1
safe 1
and 1
sound 1
in 1
baker 1
street 1
once 1
more.” 1
chapter 1
6. 1
baskerville 1
hall 1
sir 1
henry 1
baskerville 1
and 1
dr. 1
mortimer 1
were 1
ready 1
upon 1
the 1
appointed 1
day, 1
and 1
we 1
started 1
as 1
arranged 1
for 1
devonshire. 1
mr. 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
drove 1
with 1
me 1
to 1
the 1
station 1
and 1
gave 1
me 1
his 1
last 1
parting 1
injunctions 1
and 1
advice. 1
“i 1
will 1
not 1
bias 1
your 1
mind 1
by 1
suggesting 1
theories 1
or 1
suspicions, 1
watson,” 1
said 1
he; 1
“i 1
wish 1
you 1
simply 1
to 1
report 1
facts 1
in 1
the 1
fullest 1
possible 1
manner 1
to 1
me, 1
and 1
you 1
can 1
leave 1
me 1
to 1
do 1
the 1
theorizing.” 1
“what 1
sort 1
of 1
facts?” 1
i 1
asked. 1
“anything 1
which 1
may 1
seem 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
bearing 1
however 1
indirect 1
upon 1
the 1
case, 1
and 1
especially 1
the 1
relations 1
between 1
young 1
baskerville 1
and 1
his 1
neighbours 1
or 1
any 1
fresh 1
particulars 1
concerning 1
the 1
death 1
of 1
sir 1
charles. 1
i 1
have 1
made 1
some 1
inquiries 1
myself 1
in 1
the 1
last 1
few 1
days, 1
but 1
the 1
results 1
have, 1
i 1
fear, 1
been 1
negative. 1
one 1
thing 1
only 1
appears 1
to 1
be 1
certain, 1
and 1
that 1
is 1
that 1
mr. 1
james 1
desmond, 1
who 1
is 1
the 1
next 1
heir, 1
is 1
an 1
elderly 1
gentleman 1
of 1
a 1
very 1
amiable 1
disposition, 1
so 1
that 1
this 1
persecution 1
does 1
not 1
arise 1
from 1
him. 1
i 1
really 1
think 1
that 1
we 1
may 1
eliminate 1
him 1
entirely 1
from 1
our 1
calculations. 1
there 1
remain 1
the 1
people 1
who 1
will 1
actually 1
surround 1
sir 1
henry 1
baskerville 1
upon 1
the 1
moor.” 1
“would 1
it 1
not 1
be 1
well 1
in 1
the 1
first 1
place 1
to 1
get 1
rid 1
of 1
this 1
barrymore 1
couple?” 1
“by 1
no 1
means. 1
you 1
could 1
not 1
make 1
a 1
greater 1
mistake. 1
if 1
they 1
are 1
innocent 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
cruel 1
injustice, 1
and 1
if 1
they 1
are 1
guilty 1
we 1
should 1
be 1
giving 1
up 1
all 1
chance 1
of 1
bringing 1
it 1
home 1
to 1
them. 1
no, 1
no, 1
we 1
will 1
preserve 1
them 1
upon 1
our 1
list 1
of 1
suspects. 1
then 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
groom 1
at 1
the 1
hall, 1
if 1
i 1
remember 1
right. 1
there 1
are 1
two 1
moorland 1
farmers. 1
there 1
is 1
our 1
friend 1
dr. 1
mortimer, 1
whom 1
i 1
believe 1
to 1
be 1
entirely 1
honest, 1
and 1
there 1
is 1
his 1
wife, 1
of 1
whom 1
we 1
know 1
nothing. 1
there 1
is 1
this 1
naturalist, 1
stapleton, 1
and 1
there 1
is 1
his 1
sister, 1
who 1
is 1
said 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
young 1
lady 1
of 1
attractions. 1
there 1
is 1
mr. 1
frankland, 1
of 1
lafter 1
hall, 1
who 1
is 1
also 1
an 1
unknown 1
factor, 1
and 1
there 1
are 1
one 1
or 1
two 1
other 1
neighbours. 1
these 1
are 1
the 1
folk 1
who 1
must 1
be 1
your 1
very 1
special 1
study.” 1
“i 1
will 1
do 1
my 1
best.” 1
“you 1
have 1
arms, 1
i 1
suppose?” 1
“yes, 1
i 1
thought 1
it 1
as 1
well 1
to 1
take 1
them.” 1
“most 1
certainly. 1
keep 1
your 1
revolver 1
near 1
you 1
night 1
and 1
day, 1
and 1
never 1
relax 1
your 1
precautions.” 1
our 1
friends 1
had 1
already 1
secured 1
a 1
first-class 1
carriage 1
and 1
were 1
waiting 1
for 1
us 1
upon 1
the 1
platform. 1
“no, 1
we 1
have 1
no 1
news 1
of 1
any 1
kind,” 1
said 1
dr. 1
mortimer 1
in 1
answer 1
to 1
my 1
friend’s 1
questions. 1
“i 1
can 1
swear 1
to 1
one 1
thing, 1
and 1
that 1
is 1
that 1
we 1
have 1
not 1
been 1
shadowed 1
during 1
the 1
last 1
two 1
days. 1
we 1
have 1
never 1
gone 1
out 1
without 1
keeping 1
a 1
sharp 1
watch, 1
and 1
no 1
one 1
could 1
have 1
escaped 1
our 1
notice.” 1
“you 1
have 1
always 1
kept 1
together, 1
i 1
presume?” 1
“except 1
yesterday 1
afternoon. 1
i 1
usually 1
give 1
up 1
one 1
day 1
to 1
pure 1
amusement 1
when 1
i 1
come 1
to 1
town, 1
so 1
i 1
spent 1
it 1
at 1
the 1
museum 1
of 1
the 1
college 1
of 1
surgeons.” 1
“and 1
i 1
went 1
to 1
look 1
at 1
the 1
folk 1
in 1
the 1
park,” 1
said 1
baskerville. 1
“but 1
we 1
had 1
no 1
trouble 1
of 1
any 1
kind.” 1
“it 1
was 1
imprudent, 1
all 1
the 1
same,” 1
said 1
holmes, 1
shaking 1
his 1
head 1
and 1
looking 1
very 1
grave. 1
“i 1
beg, 1
sir 1
henry, 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
not 1
go 1
about 1
alone. 1
some 1
great 1
misfortune 1
will 1
befall 1
you 1
if 1
you 1
do. 1
did 1
you 1
get 1
your 1
other 1
boot?” 1
“no, 1
sir, 1
it 1
is 1
gone 1
forever.” 1
“indeed. 1
that 1
is 1
very 1
interesting. 1
well, 1
good-bye,” 1
he 1
added 1
as 1
the 1
train 1
began 1
to 1
glide 1
down 1
the 1
platform. 1
“bear 1
in 1
mind, 1
sir 1
henry, 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
phrases 1
in 1
that 1
queer 1
old 1
legend 1
which 1
dr. 1
mortimer 1
has 1
read 1
to 1
us, 1
and 1
avoid 1
the 1
moor 1
in 1
those 1
hours 1
of 1
darkness 1
when 1
the 1
powers 1
of 1
evil 1
are 1
exalted.” 1
i 1
looked 1
back 1
at 1
the 1
platform 1
when 1
we 1
had 1
left 1
it 1
far 1
behind 1
and 1
saw 1
the 1
tall, 1
austere 1
figure 1
of 1
holmes 1
standing 1
motionless 1
and 1
gazing 1
after 1
us. 1
the 1
journey 1
was 1
a 1
swift 1
and 1
pleasant 1
one, 1
and 1
i 1
spent 1
it 1
in 1
making 1
the 1
more 1
intimate 1
acquaintance 1
of 1
my 1
two 1
companions 1
and 1
in 1
playing 1
with 1
dr. 1
mortimer’s 1
spaniel. 1
in 1
a 1
very 1
few 1
hours 1
the 1
brown 1
earth 1
had 1
become 1
ruddy, 1
the 1
brick 1
had 1
changed 1
to 1
granite, 1
and 1
red 1
cows 1
grazed 1
in 1
well-hedged 1
fields 1
where 1
the 1
lush 1
grasses 1
and 1
more 1
luxuriant 1
vegetation 1
spoke 1
of 1
a 1
richer, 1
if 1
a 1
damper, 1
climate. 1
young 1
baskerville 1
stared 1
eagerly 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
window 1
and 1
cried 1
aloud 1
with 1
delight 1
as 1
he 1
recognized 1
the 1
familiar 1
features 1
of 1
the 1
devon 1
scenery. 1
“i’ve 1
been 1
over 1
a 1
good 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
since 1
i 1
left 1
it, 1
dr. 1
watson,” 1
said 1
he; 1
“but 1
i 1
have 1
never 1
seen 1
a 1
place 1
to 1
compare 1
with 1
it.” 1
“i 1
never 1
saw 1
a 1
devonshire 1
man 1
who 1
did 1
not 1
swear 1
by 1
his 1
county,” 1
i 1
remarked. 1
“it 1
depends 1
upon 1
the 1
breed 1
of 1
men 1
quite 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
on 1
the 1
county,” 1
said 1
dr. 1
mortimer. 1
“a 1
glance 1
at 1
our 1
friend 1
here 1
reveals 1
the 1
rounded 1
head 1
of 1
the 1
celt, 1
which 1
carries 1
inside 1
it 1
the 1
celtic 1
enthusiasm 1
and 1
power 1
of 1
attachment. 1
poor 1
sir 1
charles’s 1
head 1
was 1
of 1
a 1
very 1
rare 1
type, 1
half 1
gaelic, 1
half 1
ivernian 1
in 1
its 1
characteristics. 1
but 1
you 1
were 1
very 1
young 1
when 1
you 1
last 1
saw 1
baskerville 1
hall, 1
were 1
you 1
not?” 1
“i 1
was 1
a 1
boy 1
in 1
my 1
teens 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
of 1
my 1
father’s 1
death 1
and 1
had 1
never 1
seen 1
the 1
hall, 1
for 1
he 1
lived 1
in 1
a 1
little 1
cottage 1
on 1
the 1
south 1
coast. 1
thence 1
i 1
went 1
straight 1
to 1
a 1
friend 1
in 1
america. 1
i 1
tell 1
you 1
it 1
is 1
all 1
as 1
new 1
to 1
me 1
as 1
it 1
is 1
to 1
dr. 1
watson, 1
and 1
i’m 1
as 1
keen 1
as 1
possible 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
moor.” 1
“are 1
you? 1
then 1
your 1
wish 1
is 1
easily 1
granted, 1
for 1
there 1
is 1
your 1
first 1
sight 1
of 1
the 1
moor,” 1
said 1
dr. 1
mortimer, 1
pointing 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
carriage 1
window. 1
over 1
the 1
green 1
squares 1
of 1
the 1
fields 1
and 1
the 1
low 1
curve 1
of 1
a 1
wood 1
there 1
rose 1
in 1
the 1
distance 1
a 1
grey, 1
melancholy 1
hill, 1
with 1
a 1
strange 1
jagged 1
summit, 1
dim 1
and 1
vague 1
in 1
the 1
distance, 1
like 1
some 1
fantastic 1
landscape 1
in 1
a 1
dream. 1
baskerville 1
sat 1
for 1
a 1
long 1
time, 1
his 1
eyes 1
fixed 1
upon 1
it, 1
and 1
i 1
read 1
upon 1
his 1
eager 1
face 1
how 1
much 1
it 1
meant 1
to 1
him, 1
this 1
first 1
sight 1
of 1
that 1
strange 1
spot 1
where 1
the 1
men 1
of 1
his 1
blood 1
had 1
held 1
sway 1
so 1
long 1
and 1
left 1
their 1
mark 1
so 1
deep. 1
there 1
he 1
sat, 1
with 1
his 1
tweed 1
suit 1
and 1
his 1
american 1
accent, 1
in 1
the 1
corner 1
of 1
a 1
prosaic 1
railway-carriage, 1
and 1
yet 1
as 1
i 1
looked 1
at 1
his 1
dark 1
and 1
expressive 1
face 1
i 1
felt 1
more 1
than 1
ever 1
how 1
true 1
a 1
descendant 1
he 1
was 1
of 1
that 1
long 1
line 1
of 1
high-blooded, 1
fiery, 1
and 1
masterful 1
men. 1
there 1
were 1
pride, 1
valour, 1
and 1
strength 1
in 1
his 1
thick 1
brows, 1
his 1
sensitive 1
nostrils, 1
and 1
his 1
large 1
hazel 1
eyes. 1
if 1
on 1
that 1
forbidding 1
moor 1
a 1
difficult 1
and 1
dangerous 1
quest 1
should 1
lie 1
before 1
us, 1
this 1
was 1
at 1
least 1
a 1
comrade 1
for 1
whom 1
one 1
might 1
venture 1
to 1
take 1
a 1
risk 1
with 1
the 1
certainty 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
bravely 1
share 1
it. 1
the 1
train 1
pulled 1
up 1
at 1
a 1
small 1
wayside 1
station 1
and 1
we 1
all 1
descended. 1
outside, 1
beyond 1
the 1
low, 1
white 1
fence, 1
a 1
wagonette 1
with 1
a 1
pair 1
of 1
cobs 1
was 1
waiting. 1
our 1
coming 1
was 1
evidently 1
a 1
great 1
event, 1
for 1
station-master 1
and 1
porters 1
clustered 1
round 1
us 1
to 1
carry 1
out 1
our 1
luggage. 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
sweet, 1
simple 1
country 1
spot, 1
but 1
i 1
was 1
surprised 1
to 1
observe 1
that 1
by 1
the 1
gate 1
there 1
stood 1
two 1
soldierly 1
men 1
in 1
dark 1
uniforms 1
who 1
leaned 1
upon 1
their 1
short 1
rifles 1
and 1
glanced 1
keenly 1
at 1
us 1
as 1
we 1
passed. 1
the 1
coachman, 1
a 1
hard-faced, 1
gnarled 1
little 1
fellow, 1
saluted 1
sir 1
henry 1
baskerville, 1
and 1
in 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
we 1
were 1
flying 1
swiftly 1
down 1
the 1
broad, 1
white 1
road. 1
rolling 1
pasture 1
lands 1
curved 1
upward 1
on 1
either 1
side 1
of 1
us, 1
and 1
old 1
gabled 1
houses 1
peeped 1
out 1
from 1
amid 1
the 1
thick 1
green 1
foliage, 1
but 1
behind 1
the 1
peaceful 1
and 1
sunlit 1
countryside 1
there 1
rose 1
ever, 1
dark 1
against 1
the 1
evening 1
sky, 1
the 1
long, 1
gloomy 1
curve 1
of 1
the 1
moor, 1
broken 1
by 1
the 1
jagged 1
and 1
sinister 1
hills. 1
the 1
wagonette 1
swung 1
round 1
into 1
a 1
side 1
road, 1
and 1
we 1
curved 1
upward 1
through 1
deep 1
lanes 1
worn 1
by 1
centuries 1
of 1
wheels, 1
high 1
banks 1
on 1
either 1
side, 1
heavy 1
with 1
dripping 1
moss 1
and 1
fleshy 1
hart’s-tongue 1
ferns. 1
bronzing 1
bracken 1
and 1
mottled 1
bramble 1
gleamed 1
in 1
the 1
light 1
of 1
the 1
sinking 1
sun. 1
still 1
steadily 1
rising, 1
we 1
passed 1
over 1
a 1
narrow 1
granite 1
bridge 1
and 1
skirted 1
a 1
noisy 1
stream 1
which 1
gushed 1
swiftly 1
down, 1
foaming 1
and 1
roaring 1
amid 1
the 1
grey 1
boulders. 1
both 1
road 1
and 1
stream 1
wound 1
up 1
through 1
a 1
valley 1
dense 1
with 1
scrub 1
oak 1
and 1
fir. 1
at 1
every 1
turn 1
baskerville 1
gave 1
an 1
exclamation 1
of 1
delight, 1
looking 1
eagerly 1
about 1
him 1
and 1
asking 1
countless 1
questions. 1
to 1
his 1
eyes 1
all 1
seemed 1
beautiful, 1
but 1
to 1
me 1
a 1
tinge 1
of 1
melancholy 1
lay 1
upon 1
the 1
countryside, 1
which 1
bore 1
so 1
clearly 1
the 1
mark 1
of 1
the 1
waning 1
year. 1
yellow 1
leaves 1
carpeted 1
the 1
lanes 1
and 1
fluttered 1
down 1
upon 1
us 1
as 1
we 1
passed. 1
the 1
rattle 1
of 1
our 1
wheels 1
died 1
away 1
as 1
we 1
drove 1
through 1
drifts 1
of 1
rotting 1
vegetation—sad 1
gifts, 1
as 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
me, 1
for 1
nature 1
to 1
throw 1
before 1
the 1
carriage 1
of 1
the 1
returning 1
heir 1
of 1
the 1
baskervilles. 1
“halloa!” 1
cried 1
dr. 1
mortimer, 1
“what 1
is 1
this?” 1
a 1
steep 1
curve 1
of 1
heath-clad 1
land, 1
an 1
outlying 1
spur 1
of 1
the 1
moor, 1
lay 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
us. 1
on 1
the 1
summit, 1
hard 1
and 1
clear 1
like 1
an 1
equestrian 1
statue 1
upon 1
its 1
pedestal, 1
was 1
a 1
mounted 1
soldier, 1
dark 1
and 1
stern, 1
his 1
rifle 1
poised 1
ready 1
over 1
his 1
forearm. 1
he 1
was 1
watching 1
the 1
road 1
along 1
which 1
we 1
travelled. 1
“what 1
is 1
this, 1
perkins?” 1
asked 1
dr. 1
mortimer. 1
our 1
driver 1
half 1
turned 1
in 1
his 1
seat. 1
“there’s 1
a 1
convict 1
escaped 1
from 1
princetown, 1
sir. 1
he’s 1
been 1
out 1
three 1
days 1
now, 1
and 1
the 1
warders 1
watch 1
every 1
road 1
and 1
every 1
station, 1
but 1
they’ve 1
had 1
no 1
sight 1
of 1
him 1
yet. 1
the 1
farmers 1
about 1
here 1
don’t 1
like 1
it, 1
sir, 1
and 1
that’s 1
a 1
fact.” 1
“well, 1
i 1
understand 1
that 1
they 1
get 1
five 1
pounds 1
if 1
they 1
can 1
give 1
information.” 1
“yes, 1
sir, 1
but 1
the 1
chance 1
of 1
five 1
pounds 1
is 1
but 1
a 1
poor 1
thing 1
compared 1
to 1
the 1
chance 1
of 1
having 1
your 1
throat 1
cut. 1
you 1
see, 1
it 1
isn’t 1
like 1
any 1
ordinary 1
convict. 1
this 1
is 1
a 1
man 1
that 1
would 1
stick 1
at 1
nothing.” 1
“who 1
is 1
he, 1
then?” 1
“it 1
is 1
selden, 1
the 1
notting 1
hill 1
murderer.” 1
i 1
remembered 1
the 1
case 1
well, 1
for 1
it 1
was 1
one 1
in 1
which 1
holmes 1
had 1
taken 1
an 1
interest 1
on 1
account 1
of 1
the 1
peculiar 1
ferocity 1
of 1
the 1
crime 1
and 1
the 1
wanton 1
brutality 1
which 1
had 1
marked 1
all 1
the 1
actions 1
of 1
the 1
assassin. 1
the 1
commutation 1
of 1
his 1
death 1
sentence 1
had 1
been 1
due 1
to 1
some 1
doubts 1
as 1
to 1
his 1
complete 1
sanity, 1
so 1
atrocious 1
was 1
his 1
conduct. 1
our 1
wagonette 1
had 1
topped 1
a 1
rise 1
and 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
us 1
rose 1
the 1
huge 1
expanse 1
of 1
the 1
moor, 1
mottled 1
with 1
gnarled 1
and 1
craggy 1
cairns 1
and 1
tors. 1
a 1
cold 1
wind 1
swept 1
down 1
from 1
it 1
and 1
set 1
us 1
shivering. 1
somewhere 1
there, 1
on 1
that 1
desolate 1
plain, 1
was 1
lurking 1
this 1
fiendish 1
man, 1
hiding 1
in 1
a 1
burrow 1
like 1
a 1
wild 1
beast, 1
his 1
heart 1
full 1
of 1
malignancy 1
against 1
the 1
whole 1
race 1
which 1
had 1
cast 1
him 1
out. 1
it 1
needed 1
but 1
this 1
to 1
complete 1
the 1
grim 1
suggestiveness 1
of 1
the 1
barren 1
waste, 1
the 1
chilling 1
wind, 1
and 1
the 1
darkling 1
sky. 1
even 1
baskerville 1
fell 1
silent 1
and 1
pulled 1
his 1
overcoat 1
more 1
closely 1
around 1
him. 1
we 1
had 1
left 1
the 1
fertile 1
country 1
behind 1
and 1
beneath 1
us. 1
we 1
looked 1
back 1
on 1
it 1
now, 1
the 1
slanting 1
rays 1
of 1
a 1
low 1
sun 1
turning 1
the 1
streams 1
to 1
threads 1
of 1
gold 1
and 1
glowing 1
on 1
the 1
red 1
earth 1
new 1
turned 1
by 1
the 1
plough 1
and 1
the 1
broad 1
tangle 1
of 1
the 1
woodlands. 1
the 1
road 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
us 1
grew 1
bleaker 1
and 1
wilder 1
over 1
huge 1
russet 1
and 1
olive 1
slopes, 1
sprinkled 1
with 1
giant 1
boulders. 1
now 1
and 1
then 1
we 1
passed 1
a 1
moorland 1
cottage, 1
walled 1
and 1
roofed 1
with 1
stone, 1
with 1
no 1
creeper 1
to 1
break 1
its 1
harsh 1
outline. 1
suddenly 1
we 1
looked 1
down 1
into 1
a 1
cuplike 1
depression, 1
patched 1
with 1
stunted 1
oaks 1
and 1
firs 1
which 1
had 1
been 1
twisted 1
and 1
bent 1
by 1
the 1
fury 1
of 1
years 1
of 1
storm. 1
two 1
high, 1
narrow 1
towers 1
rose 1
over 1
the 1
trees. 1
the 1
driver 1
pointed 1
with 1
his 1
whip. 1
“baskerville 1
hall,” 1
said 1
he. 1
its 1
master 1
had 1
risen 1
and 1
was 1
staring 1
with 1
flushed 1
cheeks 1
and 1
shining 1
eyes. 1
a 1
few 1
minutes 1
later 1
we 1
had 1
reached 1
the 1
lodge-gates, 1
a 1
maze 1
of 1
fantastic 1
tracery 1
in 1
wrought 1
iron, 1
with 1
weather-bitten 1
pillars 1
on 1
either 1
side, 1
blotched 1
with 1
lichens, 1
and 1
surmounted 1
by 1
the 1
boars’ 1
heads 1
of 1
the 1
baskervilles. 1
the 1
lodge 1
was 1
a 1
ruin 1
of 1
black 1
granite 1
and 1
bared 1
ribs 1
of 1
rafters, 1
but 1
facing 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
new 1
building, 1
half 1
constructed, 1
the 1
first 1
fruit 1
of 1
sir 1
charles’s 1
south 1
african 1
gold. 1
through 1
the 1
gateway 1
we 1
passed 1
into 1
the 1
avenue, 1
where 1
the 1
wheels 1
were 1
again 1
hushed 1
amid 1
the 1
leaves, 1
and 1
the 1
old 1
trees 1
shot 1
their 1
branches 1
in 1
a 1
sombre 1
tunnel 1
over 1
our 1
heads. 1
baskerville 1
shuddered 1
as 1
he 1
looked 1
up 1
the 1
long, 1
dark 1
drive 1
to 1
where 1
the 1
house 1
glimmered 1
like 1
a 1
ghost 1
at 1
the 1
farther 1
end. 1
“was 1
it 1
here?” 1
he 1
asked 1
in 1
a 1
low 1
voice. 1
“no, 1
no, 1
the 1
yew 1
alley 1
is 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
side.” 1
the 1
young 1
heir 1
glanced 1
round 1
with 1
a 1
gloomy 1
face. 1
“it’s 1
no 1
wonder 1
my 1
uncle 1
felt 1
as 1
if 1
trouble 1
were 1
coming 1
on 1
him 1
in 1
such 1
a 1
place 1
as 1
this,” 1
said 1
he. 1
“it’s 1
enough 1
to 1
scare 1
any 1
man. 1
i’ll 1
have 1
a 1
row 1
of 1
electric 1
lamps 1
up 1
here 1
inside 1
of 1
six 1
months, 1
and 1
you 1
won’t 1
know 1
it 1
again, 1
with 1
a 1
thousand 1
candle-power 1
swan 1
and 1
edison 1
right 1
here 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
hall 1
door.” 1
the 1
avenue 1
opened 1
into 1
a 1
broad 1
expanse 1
of 1
turf, 1
and 1
the 1
house 1
lay 1
before 1
us. 1
in 1
the 1
fading 1
light 1
i 1
could 1
see 1
that 1
the 1
centre 1
was 1
a 1
heavy 1
block 1
of 1
building 1
from 1
which 1
a 1
porch 1
projected. 1
the 1
whole 1
front 1
was 1
draped 1
in 1
ivy, 1
with 1
a 1
patch 1
clipped 1
bare 1
here 1
and 1
there 1
where 1
a 1
window 1
or 1
a 1
coat 1
of 1
arms 1
broke 1
through 1
the 1
dark 1
veil. 1
from 1
this 1
central 1
block 1
rose 1
the 1
twin 1
towers, 1
ancient, 1
crenelated, 1
and 1
pierced 1
with 1
many 1
loopholes. 1
to 1
right 1
and 1
left 1
of 1
the 1
turrets 1
were 1
more 1
modern 1
wings 1
of 1
black 1
granite. 1
a 1
dull 1
light 1
shone 1
through 1
heavy 1
mullioned 1
windows, 1
and 1
from 1
the 1
high 1
chimneys 1
which 1
rose 1
from 1
the 1
steep, 1
high-angled 1
roof 1
there 1
sprang 1
a 1
single 1
black 1
column 1
of 1
smoke. 1
“welcome, 1
sir 1
henry! 1
welcome 1
to 1
baskerville 1
hall!” 1
a 1
tall 1
man 1
had 1
stepped 1
from 1
the 1
shadow 1
of 1
the 1
porch 1
to 1
open 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
the 1
wagonette. 1
the 1
figure 1
of 1
a 1
woman 1
was 1
silhouetted 1
against 1
the 1
yellow 1
light 1
of 1
the 1
hall. 1
she 1
came 1
out 1
and 1
helped 1
the 1
man 1
to 1
hand 1
down 1
our 1
bags. 1
“you 1
don’t 1
mind 1
my 1
driving 1
straight 1
home, 1
sir 1
henry?” 1
said 1
dr. 1
mortimer. 1
“my 1
wife 1
is 1
expecting 1
me.” 1
“surely 1
you 1
will 1
stay 1
and 1
have 1
some 1
dinner?” 1
“no, 1
i 1
must 1
go. 1
i 1
shall 1
probably 1
find 1
some 1
work 1
awaiting 1
me. 1
i 1
would 1
stay 1
to 1
show 1
you 1
over 1
the 1
house, 1
but 1
barrymore 1
will 1
be 1
a 1
better 1
guide 1
than 1
i. 1
good-bye, 1
and 1
never 1
hesitate 1
night 1
or 1
day 1
to 1
send 1
for 1
me 1
if 1
i 1
can 1
be 1
of 1
service.” 1
the 1
wheels 1
died 1
away 1
down 1
the 1
drive 1
while 1
sir 1
henry 1
and 1
i 1
turned 1
into 1
the 1
hall, 1
and 1
the 1
door 1
clanged 1
heavily 1
behind 1
us. 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
fine 1
apartment 1
in 1
which 1
we 1
found 1
ourselves, 1
large, 1
lofty, 1
and 1
heavily 1
raftered 1
with 1
huge 1
baulks 1
of 1
age-blackened 1
oak. 1
in 1
the 1
great 1
old-fashioned 1
fireplace 1
behind 1
the 1
high 1
iron 1
dogs 1
a 1
log-fire 1
crackled 1
and 1
snapped. 1
sir 1
henry 1
and 1
i 1
held 1
out 1
our 1
hands 1
to 1
it, 1
for 1
we 1
were 1
numb 1
from 1
our 1
long 1
drive. 1
then 1
we 1
gazed 1
round 1
us 1
at 1
the 1
high, 1
thin 1
window 1
of 1
old 1
stained 1
glass, 1
the 1
oak 1
panelling, 1
the 1
stags’ 1
heads, 1
the 1
coats 1
of 1
arms 1
upon 1
the 1
walls, 1
all 1
dim 1
and 1
sombre 1
in 1
the 1
subdued 1
light 1
of 1
the 1
central 1
lamp. 1
“it’s 1
just 1
as 1
i 1
imagined 1
it,” 1
said 1
sir 1
henry. 1
“is 1
it 1
not 1
the 1
very 1
picture 1
of 1
an 1
old 1
family 1
home? 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
this 1
should 1
be 1
the 1
same 1
hall 1
in 1
which 1
for 1
five 1
hundred 1
years 1
my 1
people 1
have 1
lived. 1
it 1
strikes 1
me 1
solemn 1
to 1
think 1
of 1
it.” 1
i 1
saw 1
his 1
dark 1
face 1
lit 1
up 1
with 1
a 1
boyish 1
enthusiasm 1
as 1
he 1
gazed 1
about 1
him. 1
the 1
light 1
beat 1
upon 1
him 1
where 1
he 1
stood, 1
but 1
long 1
shadows 1
trailed 1
down 1
the 1
walls 1
and 1
hung 1
like 1
a 1
black 1
canopy 1
above 1
him. 1
barrymore 1
had 1
returned 1
from 1
taking 1
our 1
luggage 1
to 1
our 1
rooms. 1
he 1
stood 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
us 1
now 1
with 1
the 1
subdued 1
manner 1
of 1
a 1
well-trained 1
servant. 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
remarkable-looking 1
man, 1
tall, 1
handsome, 1
with 1
a 1
square 1
black 1
beard 1
and 1
pale, 1
distinguished 1
features. 1
“would 1
you 1
wish 1
dinner 1
to 1
be 1
served 1
at 1
once, 1
sir?” 1
“is 1
it 1
ready?” 1
“in 1
a 1
very 1
few 1
minutes, 1
sir. 1
you 1
will 1
find 1
hot 1
water 1
in 1
your 1
rooms. 1
my 1
wife 1
and 1
i 1
will 1
be 1
happy, 1
sir 1
henry, 1
to 1
stay 1
with 1
you 1
until 1
you 1
have 1
made 1
your 1
fresh 1
arrangements, 1
but 1
you 1
will 1
understand 1
that 1
under 1
the 1
new 1
conditions 1
this 1
house 1
will 1
require 1
a 1
considerable 1
staff.” 1
“what 1
new 1
conditions?” 1
“i 1
only 1
meant, 1
sir, 1
that 1
sir 1
charles 1
led 1
a 1
very 1
retired 1
life, 1
and 1
we 1
were 1
able 1
to 1
look 1
after 1
his 1
wants. 1
you 1
would, 1
naturally, 1
wish 1
to 1
have 1
more 1
company, 1
and 1
so 1
you 1
will 1
need 1
changes 1
in 1
your 1
household.” 1
“do 1
you 1
mean 1
that 1
your 1
wife 1
and 1
you 1
wish 1
to 1
leave?” 1
“only 1
when 1
it 1
is 1
quite 1
convenient 1
to 1
you, 1
sir.” 1
“but 1
your 1
family 1
have 1
been 1
with 1
us 1
for 1
several 1
generations, 1
have 1
they 1
not? 1
i 1
should 1
be 1
sorry 1
to 1
begin 1
my 1
life 1
here 1
by 1
breaking 1
an 1
old 1
family 1
connection.” 1
i 1
seemed 1
to 1
discern 1
some 1
signs 1
of 1
emotion 1
upon 1
the 1
butler’s 1
white 1
face. 1
“i 1
feel 1
that 1
also, 1
sir, 1
and 1
so 1
does 1
my 1
wife. 1
but 1
to 1
tell 1
the 1
truth, 1
sir, 1
we 1
were 1
both 1
very 1
much 1
attached 1
to 1
sir 1
charles, 1
and 1
his 1
death 1
gave 1
us 1
a 1
shock 1
and 1
made 1
these 1
surroundings 1
very 1
painful 1
to 1
us. 1
i 1
fear 1
that 1
we 1
shall 1
never 1
again 1
be 1
easy 1
in 1
our 1
minds 1
at 1
baskerville 1
hall.” 1
“but 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
intend 1
to 1
do?” 1
“i 1
have 1
no 1
doubt, 1
sir, 1
that 1
we 1
shall 1
succeed 1
in 1
establishing 1
ourselves 1
in 1
some 1
business. 1
sir 1
charles’s 1
generosity 1
has 1
given 1
us 1
the 1
means 1
to 1
do 1
so. 1
and 1
now, 1
sir, 1
perhaps 1
i 1
had 1
best 1
show 1
you 1
to 1
your 1
rooms.” 1
a 1
square 1
balustraded 1
gallery 1
ran 1
round 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
the 1
old 1
hall, 1
approached 1
by 1
a 1
double 1
stair. 1
from 1
this 1
central 1
point 1
two 1
long 1
corridors 1
extended 1
the 1
whole 1
length 1
of 1
the 1
building, 1
from 1
which 1
all 1
the 1
bedrooms 1
opened. 1
my 1
own 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
wing 1
as 1
baskerville’s 1
and 1
almost 1
next 1
door 1
to 1
it. 1
these 1
rooms 1
appeared 1
to 1
be 1
much 1
more 1
modern 1
than 1
the 1
central 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
house, 1
and 1
the 1
bright 1
paper 1
and 1
numerous 1
candles 1
did 1
something 1
to 1
remove 1
the 1
sombre 1
impression 1
which 1
our 1
arrival 1
had 1
left 1
upon 1
my 1
mind. 1
but 1
the 1
dining-room 1
which 1
opened 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
hall 1
was 1
a 1
place 1
of 1
shadow 1
and 1
gloom. 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
long 1
chamber 1
with 1
a 1
step 1
separating 1
the 1
dais 1
where 1
the 1
family 1
sat 1
from 1
the 1
lower 1
portion 1
reserved 1
for 1
their 1
dependents. 1
at 1
one 1
end 1
a 1
minstrel’s 1
gallery 1
overlooked 1
it. 1
black 1
beams 1
shot 1
across 1
above 1
our 1
heads, 1
with 1
a 1
smoke-darkened 1
ceiling 1
beyond 1
them. 1
with 1
rows 1
of 1
flaring 1
torches 1
to 1
light 1
it 1
up, 1
and 1
the 1
colour 1
and 1
rude 1
hilarity 1
of 1
an 1
old-time 1
banquet, 1
it 1
might 1
have 1
softened; 1
but 1
now, 1
when 1
two 1
black-clothed 1
gentlemen 1
sat 1
in 1
the 1
little 1
circle 1
of 1
light 1
thrown 1
by 1
a 1
shaded 1
lamp, 1
one’s 1
voice 1
became 1
hushed 1
and 1
one’s 1
spirit 1
subdued. 1
a 1
dim 1
line 1
of 1
ancestors, 1
in 1
every 1
variety 1
of 1
dress, 1
from 1
the 1
elizabethan 1
knight 1
to 1
the 1
buck 1
of 1
the 1
regency, 1
stared 1
down 1
upon 1
us 1
and 1
daunted 1
us 1
by 1
their 1
silent 1
company. 1
we 1
talked 1
little, 1
and 1
i 1
for 1
one 1
was 1
glad 1
when 1
the 1
meal 1
was 1
over 1
and 1
we 1
were 1
able 1
to 1
retire 1
into 1
the 1
modern 1
billiard-room 1
and 1
smoke 1
a 1
cigarette. 1
“my 1
word, 1
it 1
isn’t 1
a 1
very 1
cheerful 1
place,” 1
said 1
sir 1
henry. 1
“i 1
suppose 1
one 1
can 1
tone 1
down 1
to 1
it, 1
but 1
i 1
feel 1
a 1
bit 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
picture 1
at 1
present. 1
i 1
don’t 1
wonder 1
that 1
my 1
uncle 1
got 1
a 1
little 1
jumpy 1
if 1
he 1
lived 1
all 1
alone 1
in 1
such 1
a 1
house 1
as 1
this. 1
however, 1
if 1
it 1
suits 1
you, 1
we 1
will 1
retire 1
early 1
tonight, 1
and 1
perhaps 1
things 1
may 1
seem 1
more 1
cheerful 1
in 1
the 1
morning.” 1
i 1
drew 1
aside 1
my 1
curtains 1
before 1
i 1
went 1
to 1
bed 1
and 1
looked 1
out 1
from 1
my 1
window. 1
it 1
opened 1
upon 1
the 1
grassy 1
space 1
which 1
lay 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
hall 1
door. 1
beyond, 1
two 1
copses 1
of 1
trees 1
moaned 1
and 1
swung 1
in 1
a 1
rising 1
wind. 1
a 1
half 1
moon 1
broke 1
through 1
the 1
rifts 1
of 1
racing 1
clouds. 1
in 1
its 1
cold 1
light 1
i 1
saw 1
beyond 1
the 1
trees 1
a 1
broken 1
fringe 1
of 1
rocks, 1
and 1
the 1
long, 1
low 1
curve 1
of 1
the 1
melancholy 1
moor. 1
i 1
closed 1
the 1
curtain, 1
feeling 1
that 1
my 1
last 1
impression 1
was 1
in 1
keeping 1
with 1
the 1
rest. 1
and 1
yet 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
quite 1
the 1
last. 1
i 1
found 1
myself 1
weary 1
and 1
yet 1
wakeful, 1
tossing 1
restlessly 1
from 1
side 1
to 1
side, 1
seeking 1
for 1
the 1
sleep 1
which 1
would 1
not 1
come. 1
far 1
away 1
a 1
chiming 1
clock 1
struck 1
out 1
the 1
quarters 1
of 1
the 1
hours, 1
but 1
otherwise 1
a 1
deathly 1
silence 1
lay 1
upon 1
the 1
old 1
house. 1
and 1
then 1
suddenly, 1
in 1
the 1
very 1
dead 1
of 1
the 1
night, 1
there 1
came 1
a 1
sound 1
to 1
my 1
ears, 1
clear, 1
resonant, 1
and 1
unmistakable. 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
sob 1
of 1
a 1
woman, 1
the 1
muffled, 1
strangling 1
gasp 1
of 1
one 1
who 1
is 1
torn 1
by 1
an 1
uncontrollable 1
sorrow. 1
i 1
sat 1
up 1
in 1
bed 1
and 1
listened 1
intently. 1
the 1
noise 1
could 1
not 1
have 1
been 1
far 1
away 1
and 1
was 1
certainly 1
in 1
the 1
house. 1
for 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
i 1
waited 1
with 1
every 1
nerve 1
on 1
the 1
alert, 1
but 1
there 1
came 1
no 1
other 1
sound 1
save 1
the 1
chiming 1
clock 1
and 1
the 1
rustle 1
of 1
the 1
ivy 1
on 1
the 1
wall. 1
chapter 1
7. 1
the 1
stapletons 1
of 1
merripit 1
house 1
the 1
fresh 1
beauty 1
of 1
the 1
following 1
morning 1
did 1
something 1
to 1
efface 1
from 1
our 1
minds 1
the 1
grim 1
and 1
grey 1
impression 1
which 1
had 1
been 1
left 1
upon 1
both 1
of 1
us 1
by 1
our 1
first 1
experience 1
of 1
baskerville 1
hall. 1
as 1
sir 1
henry 1
and 1
i 1
sat 1
at 1
breakfast 1
the 1
sunlight 1
flooded 1
in 1
through 1
the 1
high 1
mullioned 1
windows, 1
throwing 1
watery 1
patches 1
of 1
colour 1
from 1
the 1
coats 1
of 1
arms 1
which 1
covered 1
them. 1
the 1
dark 1
panelling 1
glowed 1
like 1
bronze 1
in 1
the 1
golden 1
rays, 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
hard 1
to 1
realise 1
that 1
this 1
was 1
indeed 1
the 1
chamber 1
which 1
had 1
struck 1
such 1
a 1
gloom 1
into 1
our 1
souls 1
upon 1
the 1
evening 1
before. 1
“i 1
guess 1
it 1
is 1
ourselves 1
and 1
not 1
the 1
house 1
that 1
we 1
have 1
to 1
blame!” 1
said 1
the 1
baronet. 1
“we 1
were 1
tired 1
with 1
our 1
journey 1
and 1
chilled 1
by 1
our 1
drive, 1
so 1
we 1
took 1
a 1
grey 1
view 1
of 1
the 1
place. 1
now 1
we 1
are 1
fresh 1
and 1
well, 1
so 1
it 1
is 1
all 1
cheerful 1
once 1
more.” 1
“and 1
yet 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
entirely 1
a 1
question 1
of 1
imagination,” 1
i 1
answered. 1
“did 1
you, 1
for 1
example, 1
happen 1
to 1
hear 1
someone, 1
a 1
woman 1
i 1
think, 1
sobbing 1
in 1
the 1
night?” 1
“that 1
is 1
curious, 1
for 1
i 1
did 1
when 1
i 1
was 1
half 1
asleep 1
fancy 1
that 1
i 1
heard 1
something 1
of 1
the 1
sort. 1
i 1
waited 1
quite 1
a 1
time, 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
more 1
of 1
it, 1
so 1
i 1
concluded 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
all 1
a 1
dream.” 1
“i 1
heard 1
it 1
distinctly, 1
and 1
i 1
am 1
sure 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
really 1
the 1
sob 1
of 1
a 1
woman.” 1
“we 1
must 1
ask 1
about 1
this 1
right 1
away.” 1
he 1
rang 1
the 1
bell 1
and 1
asked 1
barrymore 1
whether 1
he 1
could 1
account 1
for 1
our 1
experience. 1
it 1
seemed 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
the 1
pallid 1
features 1
of 1
the 1
butler 1
turned 1
a 1
shade 1
paler 1
still 1
as 1
he 1
listened 1
to 1
his 1
master’s 1
question. 1
“there 1
are 1
only 1
two 1
women 1
in 1
the 1
house, 1
sir 1
henry,” 1
he 1
answered. 1
“one 1
is 1
the 1
scullery-maid, 1
who 1
sleeps 1
in 1
the 1
other 1
wing. 1
the 1
other 1
is 1
my 1
wife, 1
and 1
i 1
can 1
answer 1
for 1
it 1
that 1
the 1
sound 1
could 1
not 1
have 1
come 1
from 1
her.” 1
and 1
yet 1
he 1
lied 1
as 1
he 1
said 1
it, 1
for 1
it 1
chanced 1
that 1
after 1
breakfast 1
i 1
met 1
mrs. 1
barrymore 1
in 1
the 1
long 1
corridor 1
with 1
the 1
sun 1
full 1
upon 1
her 1
face. 1
she 1
was 1
a 1
large, 1
impassive, 1
heavy-featured 1
woman 1
with 1
a 1
stern 1
set 1
expression 1
of 1
mouth. 1
but 1
her 1
telltale 1
eyes 1
were 1
red 1
and 1
glanced 1
at 1
me 1
from 1
between 1
swollen 1
lids. 1
it 1
was 1
she, 1
then, 1
who 1
wept 1
in 1
the 1
night, 1
and 1
if 1
she 1
did 1
so 1
her 1
husband 1
must 1
know 1
it. 1
yet 1
he 1
had 1
taken 1
the 1
obvious 1
risk 1
of 1
discovery 1
in 1
declaring 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
so. 1
why 1
had 1
he 1
done 1
this? 1
and 1
why 1
did 1
she 1
weep 1
so 1
bitterly? 1
already 1
round 1
this 1
pale-faced, 1
handsome, 1
black-bearded 1
man 1
there 1
was 1
gathering 1
an 1
atmosphere 1
of 1
mystery 1
and 1
of 1
gloom. 1
it 1
was 1
he 1
who 1
had 1
been 1
the 1
first 1
to 1
discover 1
the 1
body 1
of 1
sir 1
charles, 1
and 1
we 1
had 1
only 1
his 1
word 1
for 1
all 1
the 1
circumstances 1
which 1
led 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
old 1
man’s 1
death. 1
was 1
it 1
possible 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
barrymore, 1
after 1
all, 1
whom 1
we 1
had 1
seen 1
in 1
the 1
cab 1
in 1
regent 1
street? 1
the 1
beard 1
might 1
well 1
have 1
been 1
the 1
same. 1
the 1
cabman 1
had 1
described 1
a 1
somewhat 1
shorter 1
man, 1
but 1
such 1
an 1
impression 1
might 1
easily 1
have 1
been 1
erroneous. 1
how 1
could 1
i 1
settle 1
the 1
point 1
forever? 1
obviously 1
the 1
first 1
thing 1
to 1
do 1
was 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
grimpen 1
postmaster 1
and 1
find 1
whether 1
the 1
test 1
telegram 1
had 1
really 1
been 1
placed 1
in 1
barrymore’s 1
own 1
hands. 1
be 1
the 1
answer 1
what 1
it 1
might, 1
i 1
should 1
at 1
least 1
have 1
something 1
to 1
report 1
to 1
sherlock 1
holmes. 1
sir 1
henry 1
had 1
numerous 1
papers 1
to 1
examine 1
after 1
breakfast, 1
so 1
that 1
the 1
time 1
was 1
propitious 1
for 1
my 1
excursion. 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
pleasant 1
walk 1
of 1
four 1
miles 1
along 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
the 1
moor, 1
leading 1
me 1
at 1
last 1
to 1
a 1
small 1
grey 1
hamlet, 1
in 1
which 1
two 1
larger 1
buildings, 1
which 1
proved 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
inn 1
and 1
the 1
house 1
of 1
dr. 1
mortimer, 1
stood 1
high 1
above 1
the 1
rest. 1
the 1
postmaster, 1
who 1
was 1
also 1
the 1
village 1
grocer, 1
had 1
a 1
clear 1
recollection 1
of 1
the 1
telegram. 1
“certainly, 1
sir,” 1
said 1
he, 1
“i 1
had 1
the 1
telegram 1
delivered 1
to 1
mr. 1
barrymore 1
exactly 1
as 1
directed.” 1
“who 1
delivered 1
it?” 1
“my 1
boy 1
here. 1
james, 1
you 1
delivered 1
that 1
telegram 1
to 1
mr. 1
barrymore 1
at 1
the 1
hall 1
last 1
week, 1
did 1
you 1
not?” 1
“yes, 1
father, 1
i 1
delivered 1
it.” 1
“into 1
his 1
own 1
hands?” 1
i 1
asked. 1
“well, 1
he 1
was 1
up 1
in 1
the 1
loft 1
at 1
the 1
time, 1
so 1
that 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
put 1
it 1
into 1
his 1
own 1
hands, 1
but 1
i 1
gave 1
it 1
into 1
mrs. 1
barrymore’s 1
hands, 1
and 1
she 1
promised 1
to 1
deliver 1
it 1
at 1
once.” 1
“did 1
you 1
see 1
mr. 1
barrymore?” 1
“no, 1
sir; 1
i 1
tell 1
you 1
he 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
loft.” 1
“if 1
you 1
didn’t 1
see 1
him, 1
how 1
do 1
you 1
know 1
he 1
was 1
in 1
the 1
loft?” 1
“well, 1
surely 1
his 1
own 1
wife 1
ought 1
to 1
know 1
where 1
he 1
is,” 1
said 1
the 1
postmaster 1
testily. 1
“didn’t 1
he 1
get 1
the 1
telegram? 1
if 1
there 1
is 1
any 1
mistake 1
it 1
is 1
for 1
mr. 1
barrymore 1
himself 1
to 1
complain.” 1
it 1
seemed 1
hopeless 1
to 1
pursue 1
the 1
inquiry 1
any 1
farther, 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
clear 1
that 1
in 1
spite 1
of 1
holmes’s 1
ruse 1
we 1
had 1
no 1
proof 1
that 1
barrymore 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
in 1
london 1
all 1
the 1
time. 1
suppose 1
that 1
it 1
were 1
so—suppose 1
that 1
the 1
same 1
man 1
had 1
been 1
the 1
last 1
who 1
had 1
seen 1
sir 1
charles 1
alive, 1
and 1
the 1
first 1
to 1
dog 1
the 1
new 1
heir 1
when 1
he 1
returned 1
to 1
england. 1
what 1
then? 1
was 1
he 1
the 1
agent 1
of 1
others 1
or 1
had 1
he 1
some 1
sinister 1
design 1
of 1
his 1
own? 1
what 1
interest 1
could 1
he 1
have 1
in 1
persecuting 1
the 1
baskerville 1
family? 1
i 1
thought 1
of 1
the 1
strange 1
warning 1
clipped 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
leading 1
article 1
of 1
the 1
_times_. 1
was 1
that 1
his 1
work 1
or 1
was 1
it 1
possibly 1
the 1
doing 1
of 1
someone 1
who 1
was 1
bent 1
upon 1
counteracting 1
his 1
schemes? 1
the 1
only 1
conceivable 1
motive 1
was 1
that 1
which 1
had 1
been 1
suggested 1
by 1
sir 1
henry, 1
that 1
if 1
the 1
family 1
could 1
be 1
scared 1
away 1
a 1
comfortable 1
and 1
permanent 1
home 1
would 1
be 1
secured 1
for 1
the 1
barrymores. 1
but 1
surely 1
such 1
an 1
explanation 1
as 1
that 1
would 1
be 1
quite 1
inadequate 1
to 1
account 1
for 1
the 1
deep 1
and 1
subtle 1
scheming 1
which 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
weaving 1
an 1
invisible 1
net 1
round 1
the 1
young 1
baronet. 1
holmes 1
himself 1
had 1
said 1
that 1
no 1
more 1
complex 1
case 1
had 1
come 1
to 1
him 1
in 1
all 1
the 1
long 1
series 1
of 1
his 1
sensational 1
investigations. 1
i 1
prayed, 1
as 1
i 1
walked 1
back 1
along 1
the 1
grey, 1
lonely 1
road, 1
that 1
my 1
friend 1
might 1
soon 1
be 1
freed 1
from 1
his 1
preoccupations 1
and 1
able 1
to 1
come 1
down 1
to 1
take 1
this 1
heavy 1
burden 1
of 1
responsibility 1
from 1
my 1
shoulders. 1
suddenly 1
my 1
thoughts 1
were 1
interrupted 1
by 1
the 1
sound 1
of 1
running 1
feet 1
behind 1
me 1
and 1
by 1
a 1
voice 1
which 1
called 1
me 1
by 1
name. 1
i 1
turned, 1
expecting 1
to 1
see 1
dr. 1
mortimer, 1
but 1
to 1
my 1
surprise 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
stranger 1
who 1
was 1
pursuing 1
me. 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
small, 1
slim, 1
clean-shaven, 1
prim-faced 1
man, 1
flaxen-haired 1
and 1
lean-jawed, 1
between 1
thirty 1
and 1
forty 1
years 1
of 1
age, 1
dressed 1
in 1
a 1
grey 1
suit 1
and 1
wearing 1
a 1
straw 1
hat. 1
a 1
tin 1
box 1
for 1
botanical 1
specimens 1
hung 1
over 1
his 1
shoulder 1
and 1
he 1
carried 1
a 1
green 1
butterfly-net 1
in 1
one 1
of 1
his 1
hands. 1
“you 1
will, 1
i 1
am 1
sure, 1
excuse 1
my 1
presumption, 1
dr. 1
watson,” 1
said 1
he 1
as 1
he 1
came 1
panting 1
up 1
to 1
where 1
i 1
stood. 1
“here 1
on 1
the 1
moor 1
we 1
are 1
homely 1
folk 1
and 1
do 1
not 1
wait 1
for 1
formal 1
introductions. 1
you 1
may 1
possibly 1
have 1
heard 1
my 1
name 1
from 1
our 1
mutual 1
friend, 1
mortimer. 1
i 1
am 1
stapleton, 1
of 1
merripit 1
house.” 1
“your 1
net 1
and 1
box 1
would 1
have 1
told 1
me 1
as 1
much,” 1
said 1
i, 1
“for 1
i 1
knew 1
that 1
mr. 1
stapleton 1
was 1
a 1
naturalist. 1
but 1
how 1
did 1
you 1
know 1
me?” 1
“i 1
have 1
been 1
calling 1
on 1
mortimer, 1
and 1
he 1
pointed 1
you 1
out 1
to 1
me 1
from 1
the 1
window 1
of 1
his 1
surgery 1
as 1
you 1
passed. 1
as 1
our 1
road 1
lay 1
the 1
same 1
way 1
i 1
thought 1
that 1
i 1
would 1
overtake 1
you 1
and 1
introduce 1
myself. 1
i 1
trust 1
that 1
sir 1
henry 1
is 1
none 1
the 1
worse 1
for 1
his 1
journey?” 1
“he 1
is 1
very 1
well, 1
thank 1
you.” 1
“we 1
were 1
all 1
rather 1
afraid 1
that 1
after 1
the 1
sad 1
death 1
of 1
sir 1
charles 1
the 1
new 1
baronet 1
might 1
refuse 1
to 1
live 1
here. 1
it 1
is 1
asking 1
much 1
of 1
a 1
wealthy 1
man 1
to 1
come 1
down 1
and 1
bury 1
himself 1
in 1
a 1
place 1
of 1
this 1
kind, 1
but 1
i 1
need 1
not 1
tell 1
you 1
that 1
it 1
means 1
a 1
very 1
great 1
deal 1
to 1
the 1
countryside. 1
sir 1
henry 1
has, 1
i 1
suppose, 1
no 1
superstitious 1
fears 1
in 1
the 1
matter?” 1
“i 1
do 1
not 1
think 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
likely.” 1
“of 1
course 1
you 1
know 1
the 1
legend 1
of 1
the 1
fiend 1
dog 1
which 1
haunts 1
the 1
family?” 1
“i 1
have 1
heard 1
it.” 1
“it 1
is 1
extraordinary 1
how 1
credulous 1
the 1
peasants 1
are 1
about 1
here! 1
any 1
number 1
of 1
them 1
are 1
ready 1
to 1
swear 1
that 1
they 1
have 1
seen 1
such 1
a 1
creature 1
upon 1
the 1
moor.” 1
he 1
spoke 1
with 1
a 1
smile, 1
but 1
i 1
seemed 1
to 1
read 1
in 1
his 1
eyes 1
that 1
he 1
took 1
the 1
matter 1
more 1
seriously. 1
“the 1
story 1
took 1
a 1
great 1
hold 1
upon 1
the 1
imagination 1
of 1
sir 1
charles, 1
and 1
i 1
have 1
no 1
doubt 1
that 1
it 1
led 1
to 1
his 1
tragic 1
end.” 1
“but 1
how?” 1
“his 1
nerves 1
were 1
so 1
worked 1
up 1
that 1
the 1
appearance 1
of 1
any 1
dog 1
might 1
have 1
had 1
a 1
fatal 1
effect 1
upon 1
his 1
diseased 1
heart. 1
i 1
fancy 1
that 1
he 1
really 1
did 1
see 1
something 1
of 1
the 1
kind 1
upon 1
that 1
last 1
night 1
in 1
the 1
yew 1
alley. 1
i 1
feared 1
that 1
some 1
disaster 1
might 1
occur, 1
for 1
i 1
was 1
very 1
fond 1
of 1
the 1
old 1
man, 1
and 1
i 1
knew 1
that 1
his 1
heart 1
was 1
weak.” 1
“how 1
did 1
you 1
know 1
that?” 1
“my 1
friend 1
mortimer 1
told 1
me.” 1
“you 1
think, 1
then, 1
that 1
some 1
dog 1
pursued 1
sir 1
charles, 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
died 1
of 1
fright 1
in 1
consequence?” 1
“have 1
you 1
any 1
better 1
explanation?” 1
“i 1
have 1
not 1
come 1
to 1
any 1
conclusion.” 1
“has 1
mr. 1
sherlock 1
holmes?” 1
the 1
words 1
took 1
away 1
my 1
breath 1
for 1
an 1
instant 1
but 1
a 1
glance 1
at 1
the 1
placid 1
face 1
and 1
steadfast 1
eyes 1
of 1
my 1
companion 1
showed 1
that 1
no 1
surprise 1
was 1
intended. 1
“it 1
is 1
useless 1
for 1
us 1
to 1
pretend 1
that 1
we 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
you, 1
dr. 1
watson,” 1
said 1
he. 1
“the 1
records 1
of 1
your 1
detective 1
have 1
reached 1
us 1
here, 1
and 1
you 1
could 1
not 1
celebrate 1
him 1
without 1
being 1
known 1
yourself. 1
when 1
mortimer 1
told 1
me 1
your 1
name 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
deny 1
your 1
identity. 1
if 1
you 1
are 1
here, 1
then 1
it 1
follows 1
that 1
mr. 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
is 1
interesting 1
himself 1
in 1
the 1
matter, 1
and 1
i 1
am 1
naturally 1
curious 1
to 1
know 1
what 1
view 1
he 1
may 1
take.” 1
“i 1
am 1
afraid 1
that 1
i 1
cannot 1
answer 1
that 1
question.” 1
“may 1
i 1
ask 1
if 1
he 1
is 1
going 1
to 1
honour 1
us 1
with 1
a 1
visit 1
himself?” 1
“he 1
cannot 1
leave 1
town 1
at 1
present. 1
he 1
has 1
other 1
cases 1
which 1
engage 1
his 1
attention.” 1
“what 1
a 1
pity! 1
he 1
might 1
throw 1
some 1
light 1
on 1
that 1
which 1
is 1
so 1
dark 1
to 1
us. 1
but 1
as 1
to 1
your 1
own 1
researches, 1
if 1
there 1
is 1
any 1
possible 1
way 1
in 1
which 1
i 1
can 1
be 1
of 1
service 1
to 1
you 1
i 1
trust 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
command 1
me. 1
if 1
i 1
had 1
any 1
indication 1
of 1
the 1
nature 1
of 1
your 1
suspicions 1
or 1
how 1
you 1
propose 1
to 1
investigate 1
the 1
case, 1
i 1
might 1
perhaps 1
even 1
now 1
give 1
you 1
some 1
aid 1
or 1
advice.” 1
“i 1
assure 1
you 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
simply 1
here 1
upon 1
a 1
visit 1
to 1
my 1
friend, 1
sir 1
henry, 1
and 1
that 1
i 1
need 1
no 1
help 1
of 1
any 1
kind.” 1
“excellent!” 1
said 1
stapleton. 1
“you 1
are 1
perfectly 1
right 1
to 1
be 1
wary 1
and 1
discreet. 1
i 1
am 1
justly 1
reproved 1
for 1
what 1
i 1
feel 1
was 1
an 1
unjustifiable 1
intrusion, 1
and 1
i 1
promise 1
you 1
that 1
i 1
will 1
not 1
mention 1
the 1
matter 1
again.” 1
we 1
had 1
come 1
to 1
a 1
point 1
where 1
a 1
narrow 1
grassy 1
path 1
struck 1
off 1
from 1
the 1
road 1
and 1
wound 1
away 1
across 1
the 1
moor. 1
a 1
steep, 1
boulder-sprinkled 1
hill 1
lay 1
upon 1
the 1
right 1
which 1
had 1
in 1
bygone 1
days 1
been 1
cut 1
into 1
a 1
granite 1
quarry. 1
the 1
face 1
which 1
was 1
turned 1
towards 1
us 1
formed 1
a 1
dark 1
cliff, 1
with 1
ferns 1
and 1
brambles 1
growing 1
in 1
its 1
niches. 1
from 1
over 1
a 1
distant 1
rise 1
there 1
floated 1
a 1
grey 1
plume 1
of 1
smoke. 1
“a 1
moderate 1
walk 1
along 1
this 1
moor-path 1
brings 1
us 1
to 1
merripit 1
house,” 1
said 1
he. 1
“perhaps 1
you 1
will 1
spare 1
an 1
hour 1
that 1
i 1
may 1
have 1
the 1
pleasure 1
of 1
introducing 1
you 1
to 1
my 1
sister.” 1
my 1
first 1
thought 1
was 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
be 1
by 1
sir 1
henry’s 1
side. 1
but 1
then 1
i 1
remembered 1
the 1
pile 1
of 1
papers 1
and 1
bills 1
with 1
which 1
his 1
study 1
table 1
was 1
littered. 1
it 1
was 1
certain 1
that 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
help 1
with 1
those. 1
and 1
holmes 1
had 1
expressly 1
said 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
study 1
the 1
neighbours 1
upon 1
the 1
moor. 1
i 1
accepted 1
stapleton’s 1
invitation, 1
and 1
we 1
turned 1
together 1
down 1
the 1
path. 1
“it 1
is 1
a 1
wonderful 1
place, 1
the 1
moor,” 1
said 1
he, 1
looking 1
round 1
over 1
the 1
undulating 1
downs, 1
long 1
green 1
rollers, 1
with 1
crests 1
of 1
jagged 1
granite 1
foaming 1
up 1
into 1
fantastic 1
surges. 1
“you 1
never 1
tire 1
of 1
the 1
moor. 1
you 1
cannot 1
think 1
the 1
wonderful 1
secrets 1
which 1
it 1
contains. 1
it 1
is 1
so 1
vast, 1
and 1
so 1
barren, 1
and 1
so 1
mysterious.” 1
“you 1
know 1
it 1
well, 1
then?” 1
“i 1
have 1
only 1
been 1
here 1
two 1
years. 1
the 1
residents 1
would 1
call 1
me 1
a 1
newcomer. 1
we 1
came 1
shortly 1
after 1
sir 1
charles 1
settled. 1
but 1
my 1
tastes 1
led 1
me 1
to 1
explore 1
every 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
country 1
round, 1
and 1
i 1
should 1
think 1
that 1
there 1
are 1
few 1
men 1
who 1
know 1
it 1
better 1
than 1
i 1
do.” 1
“is 1
it 1
hard 1
to 1
know?” 1
“very 1
hard. 1
you 1
see, 1
for 1
example, 1
this 1
great 1
plain 1
to 1
the 1
north 1
here 1
with 1
the 1
queer 1
hills 1
breaking 1
out 1
of 1
it. 1
do 1
you 1
observe 1
anything 1
remarkable 1
about 1
that?” 1
“it 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
rare 1
place 1
for 1
a 1
gallop.” 1
“you 1
would 1
naturally 1
think 1
so 1
and 1
the 1
thought 1
has 1
cost 1
several 1
their 1
lives 1
before 1
now. 1
you 1
notice 1
those 1
bright 1
green 1
spots 1
scattered 1
thickly 1
over 1
it?” 1
“yes, 1
they 1
seem 1
more 1
fertile 1
than 1
the 1
rest.” 1
stapleton 1
laughed. 1
“that 1
is 1
the 1
great 1
grimpen 1
mire,” 1
said 1
he. 1
“a 1
false 1
step 1
yonder 1
means 1
death 1
to 1
man 1
or 1
beast. 1
only 1
yesterday 1
i 1
saw 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
moor 1
ponies 1
wander 1
into 1
it. 1
he 1
never 1
came 1
out. 1
i 1
saw 1
his 1
head 1
for 1
quite 1
a 1
long 1
time 1
craning 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
bog-hole, 1
but 1
it 1
sucked 1
him 1
down 1
at 1
last. 1
even 1
in 1
dry 1
seasons 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
danger 1
to 1
cross 1
it, 1
but 1
after 1
these 1
autumn 1
rains 1
it 1
is 1
an 1
awful 1
place. 1
and 1
yet 1
i 1
can 1
find 1
my 1
way 1
to 1
the 1
very 1
heart 1
of 1
it 1
and 1
return 1
alive. 1
by 1
george, 1
there 1
is 1
another 1
of 1
those 1
miserable 1
ponies!” 1
something 1
brown 1
was 1
rolling 1
and 1
tossing 1
among 1
the 1
green 1
sedges. 1
then 1
a 1
long, 1
agonised, 1
writhing 1
neck 1
shot 1
upward 1
and 1
a 1
dreadful 1
cry 1
echoed 1
over 1
the 1
moor. 1
it 1
turned 1
me 1
cold 1
with 1
horror, 1
but 1
my 1
companion’s 1
nerves 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
stronger 1
than 1
mine. 1
“it’s 1
gone!” 1
said 1
he. 1
“the 1
mire 1
has 1
him. 1
two 1
in 1
two 1
days, 1
and 1
many 1
more, 1
perhaps, 1
for 1
they 1
get 1
in 1
the 1
way 1
of 1
going 1
there 1
in 1
the 1
dry 1
weather 1
and 1
never 1
know 1
the 1
difference 1
until 1
the 1
mire 1
has 1
them 1
in 1
its 1
clutches. 1
it’s 1
a 1
bad 1
place, 1
the 1
great 1
grimpen 1
mire.” 1
“and 1
you 1
say 1
you 1
can 1
penetrate 1
it?” 1
“yes, 1
there 1
are 1
one 1
or 1
two 1
paths 1
which 1
a 1
very 1
active 1
man 1
can 1
take. 1
i 1
have 1
found 1
them 1
out.” 1
“but 1
why 1
should 1
you 1
wish 1
to 1
go 1
into 1
so 1
horrible 1
a 1
place?” 1
“well, 1
you 1
see 1
the 1
hills 1
beyond? 1
they 1
are 1
really 1
islands 1
cut 1
off 1
on 1
all 1
sides 1
by 1
the 1
impassable 1
mire, 1
which 1
has 1
crawled 1
round 1
them 1
in 1
the 1
course 1
of 1
years. 1
that 1
is 1
where 1
the 1
rare 1
plants 1
and 1
the 1
butterflies 1
are, 1
if 1
you 1
have 1
the 1
wit 1
to 1
reach 1
them.” 1
“i 1
shall 1
try 1
my 1
luck 1
some 1
day.” 1
he 1
looked 1
at 1
me 1
with 1
a 1
surprised 1
face. 1
“for 1
god’s 1
sake 1
put 1
such 1
an 1
idea 1
out 1
of 1
your 1
mind,” 1
said 1
he. 1
“your 1
blood 1
would 1
be 1
upon 1
my 1
head. 1
i 1
assure 1
you 1
that 1
there 1
would 1
not 1
be 1
the 1
least 1
chance 1
of 1
your 1
coming 1
back 1
alive. 1
it 1
is 1
only 1
by 1
remembering 1
certain 1
complex 1
landmarks 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
able 1
to 1
do 1
it.” 1
“halloa!” 1
i 1
cried. 1
“what 1
is 1
that?” 1
a 1
long, 1
low 1
moan, 1
indescribably 1
sad, 1
swept 1
over 1
the 1
moor. 1
it 1
filled 1
the 1
whole 1
air, 1
and 1
yet 1
it 1
was 1
impossible 1
to 1
say 1
whence 1
it 1
came. 1
from 1
a 1
dull 1
murmur 1
it 1
swelled 1
into 1
a 1
deep 1
roar, 1
and 1
then 1
sank 1
back 1
into 1
a 1
melancholy, 1
throbbing 1
murmur 1
once 1
again. 1
stapleton 1
looked 1
at 1
me 1
with 1
a 1
curious 1
expression 1
in 1
his 1
face. 1
“queer 1
place, 1
the 1
moor!” 1
said 1
he. 1
“but 1
what 1
is 1
it?” 1
“the 1
peasants 1
say 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
hound 1
of 1
the 1
baskervilles 1
calling 1
for 1
its 1
prey. 1
i’ve 1
heard 1
it 1
once 1
or 1
twice 1
before, 1
but 1
never 1
quite 1
so 1
loud.” 1
i 1
looked 1
round, 1
with 1
a 1
chill 1
of 1
fear 1
in 1
my 1
heart, 1
at 1
the 1
huge 1
swelling 1
plain, 1
mottled 1
with 1
the 1
green 1
patches 1
of 1
rushes. 1
nothing 1
stirred 1
over 1
the 1
vast 1
expanse 1
save 1
a 1
pair 1
of 1
ravens, 1
which 1
croaked 1
loudly 1
from 1
a 1
tor 1
behind 1
us. 1
“you 1
are 1
an 1
educated 1
man. 1
you 1
don’t 1
believe 1
such 1
nonsense 1
as 1
that?” 1
said 1
i. 1
“what 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
is 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
so 1
strange 1
a 1
sound?” 1
“bogs 1
make 1
queer 1
noises 1
sometimes. 1
it’s 1
the 1
mud 1
settling, 1
or 1
the 1
water 1
rising, 1
or 1
something.” 1
“no, 1
no, 1
that 1
was 1
a 1
living 1
voice.” 1
“well, 1
perhaps 1
it 1
was. 1
did 1
you 1
ever 1
hear 1
a 1
bittern 1
booming?” 1
“no, 1
i 1
never 1
did.” 1
“it’s 1
a 1
very 1
rare 1
bird—practically 1
extinct—in 1
england 1
now, 1
but 1
all 1
things 1
are 1
possible 1
upon 1
the 1
moor. 1
yes, 1
i 1
should 1
not 1
be 1
surprised 1
to 1
learn 1
that 1
what 1
we 1
have 1
heard 1
is 1
the 1
cry 1
of 1
the 1
last 1
