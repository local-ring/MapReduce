“yes, 1
it 1
is 1
an 1
interesting 1
instance 1
of 1
a 1
throwback, 1
which 1
appears 1
to 1
be 1
both 1
physical 1
and 1
spiritual. 1
a 1
study 1
of 1
family 1
portraits 1
is 1
enough 1
to 1
convert 1
a 1
man 1
to 1
the 1
doctrine 1
of 1
reincarnation. 1
the 1
fellow 1
is 1
a 1
baskerville—that 1
is 1
evident.” 1
“with 1
designs 1
upon 1
the 1
succession.” 1
“exactly. 1
this 1
chance 1
of 1
the 1
picture 1
has 1
supplied 1
us 1
with 1
one 1
of 1
our 1
most 1
obvious 1
missing 1
links. 1
we 1
have 1
him, 1
watson, 1
we 1
have 1
him, 1
and 1
i 1
dare 1
swear 1
that 1
before 1
tomorrow 1
night 1
he 1
will 1
be 1
fluttering 1
in 1
our 1
net 1
as 1
helpless 1
as 1
one 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
butterflies. 1
a 1
pin, 1
a 1
cork, 1
and 1
a 1
card, 1
and 1
we 1
add 1
him 1
to 1
the 1
baker 1
street 1
collection!” 1
he 1
burst 1
into 1
one 1
of 1
his 1
rare 1
fits 1
of 1
laughter 1
as 1
he 1
turned 1
away 1
from 1
the 1
picture. 1
i 1
have 1
not 1
heard 1
him 1
laugh 1
often, 1
and 1
it 1
has 1
always 1
boded 1
ill 1
to 1
somebody. 1
i 1
was 1
up 1
betimes 1
in 1
the 1
morning, 1
but 1
holmes 1
was 1
afoot 1
earlier 1
still, 1
for 1
i 1
saw 1
him 1
as 1
i 1
dressed, 1
coming 1
up 1
the 1
drive. 1
“yes, 1
we 1
should 1
have 1
a 1
full 1
day 1
today,” 1
he 1
remarked, 1
and 1
he 1
rubbed 1
his 1
hands 1
with 1
the 1
joy 1
of 1
action. 1
“the 1
nets 1
are 1
all 1
in 1
place, 1
and 1
the 1
drag 1
is 1
about 1
to 1
begin. 1
we’ll 1
know 1
before 1
the 1
day 1
is 1
out 1
whether 1
we 1
have 1
caught 1
our 1
big, 1
lean-jawed 1
pike, 1
or 1
whether 1
he 1
has 1
got 1
through 1
the 1
meshes.” 1
“have 1
you 1
been 1
on 1
the 1
moor 1
already?” 1
“i 1
have 1
sent 1
a 1
report 1
from 1
grimpen 1
to 1
princetown 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
death 1
of 1
selden. 1
i 1
think 1
i 1
can 1
promise 1
that 1
none 1
of 1
you 1
will 1
be 1
troubled 1
in 1
the 1
matter. 1
and 1
i 1
have 1
also 1
communicated 1
with 1
my 1
faithful 1
cartwright, 1
who 1
would 1
certainly 1
have 1
pined 1
away 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
my 1
hut, 1
as 1
a 1
dog 1
does 1
at 1
his 1
master’s 1
grave, 1
if 1
i 1
had 1
not 1
set 1
his 1
mind 1
at 1
rest 1
about 1
my 1
safety.” 1
“what 1
is 1
the 1
next 1
move?” 1
“to 1
see 1
sir 1
henry. 1
ah, 1
here 1
he 1
is!” 1
“good-morning, 1
holmes,” 1
said 1
the 1
baronet. 1
“you 1
look 1
like 1
a 1
general 1
who 1
is 1
planning 1
a 1
battle 1
with 1
his 1
chief 1
of 1
the 1
staff.” 1
“that 1
is 1
the 1
exact 1
situation. 1
watson 1
was 1
asking 1
for 1
orders.” 1
“and 1
so 1
do 1
i.” 1
“very 1
good. 1
you 1
are 1
engaged, 1
as 1
i 1
understand, 1
to 1
dine 1
with 1
our 1
friends 1
the 1
stapletons 1
tonight.” 1
“i 1
hope 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
come 1
also. 1
they 1
are 1
very 1
hospitable 1
people, 1
and 1
i 1
am 1
sure 1
that 1
they 1
would 1
be 1
very 1
glad 1
to 1
see 1
you.” 1
“i 1
fear 1
that 1
watson 1
and 1
i 1
must 1
go 1
to 1
london.” 1
“to 1
london?” 1
“yes, 1
i 1
think 1
that 1
we 1
should 1
be 1
more 1
useful 1
there 1
at 1
the 1
present 1
juncture.” 1
the 1
baronet’s 1
face 1
perceptibly 1
lengthened. 1
“i 1
hoped 1
that 1
you 1
were 1
going 1
to 1
see 1
me 1
through 1
this 1
business. 1
the 1
hall 1
and 1
the 1
moor 1
are 1
not 1
very 1
pleasant 1
places 1
when 1
one 1
is 1
alone.” 1
“my 1
dear 1
fellow, 1
you 1
must 1
trust 1
me 1
implicitly 1
and 1
do 1
exactly 1
what 1
i 1
tell 1
you. 1
you 1
can 1
tell 1
your 1
friends 1
that 1
we 1
should 1
have 1
been 1
happy 1
to 1
have 1
come 1
with 1
you, 1
but 1
that 1
urgent 1
business 1
required 1
us 1
to 1
be 1
in 1
town. 1
we 1
hope 1
very 1
soon 1
to 1
return 1
to 1
devonshire. 1
will 1
you 1
remember 1
to 1
give 1
them 1
that 1
message?” 1
“if 1
you 1
insist 1
upon 1
it.” 1
“there 1
is 1
no 1
alternative, 1
i 1
assure 1
you.” 1
i 1
saw 1
by 1
the 1
baronet’s 1
clouded 1
brow 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
deeply 1
hurt 1
by 1
what 1
he 1
regarded 1
as 1
our 1
desertion. 1
“when 1
do 1
you 1
desire 1
to 1
go?” 1
he 1
asked 1
coldly. 1
“immediately 1
after 1
breakfast. 1
we 1
will 1
drive 1
in 1
to 1
coombe 1
tracey, 1
but 1
watson 1
will 1
leave 1
his 1
things 1
as 1
a 1
pledge 1
that 1
he 1
will 1
come 1
back 1
to 1
you. 1
watson, 1
you 1
will 1
send 1
a 1
note 1
to 1
stapleton 1
to 1
tell 1
him 1
that 1
you 1
regret 1
that 1
you 1
cannot 1
come.” 1
“i 1
have 1
a 1
good 1
mind 1
to 1
go 1
to 1
london 1
with 1
you,” 1
said 1
the 1
baronet. 1
“why 1
should 1
i 1
stay 1
here 1
alone?” 1
“because 1
it 1
is 1
your 1
post 1
of 1
duty. 1
because 1
you 1
gave 1
me 1
your 1
word 1
that 1
you 1
would 1
do 1
as 1
you 1
were 1
told, 1
and 1
i 1
tell 1
you 1
to 1
stay.” 1
“all 1
right, 1
then, 1
i’ll 1
stay.” 1
“one 1
more 1
direction! 1
i 1
wish 1
you 1
to 1
drive 1
to 1
merripit 1
house. 1
send 1
back 1
your 1
trap, 1
however, 1
and 1
let 1
them 1
know 1
that 1
you 1
intend 1
to 1
walk 1
home.” 1
“to 1
walk 1
across 1
the 1
moor?” 1
“yes.” 1
“but 1
that 1
is 1
the 1
very 1
thing 1
which 1
you 1
have 1
so 1
often 1
cautioned 1
me 1
not 1
to 1
do.” 1
“this 1
time 1
you 1
may 1
do 1
it 1
with 1
safety. 1
if 1
i 1
had 1
not 1
every 1
confidence 1
in 1
your 1
nerve 1
and 1
courage 1
i 1
would 1
not 1
suggest 1
it, 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
essential 1
that 1
you 1
should 1
do 1
it.” 1
“then 1
i 1
will 1
do 1
it.” 1
“and 1
as 1
you 1
value 1
your 1
life 1
do 1
not 1
go 1
across 1
the 1
moor 1
in 1
any 1
direction 1
save 1
along 1
the 1
straight 1
path 1
which 1
leads 1
from 1
merripit 1
house 1
to 1
the 1
grimpen 1
road, 1
and 1
is 1
your 1
natural 1
way 1
home.” 1
“i 1
will 1
do 1
just 1
what 1
you 1
say.” 1
“very 1
good. 1
i 1
should 1
be 1
glad 1
to 1
get 1
away 1
as 1
soon 1
after 1
breakfast 1
as 1
possible, 1
so 1
as 1
to 1
reach 1
london 1
in 1
the 1
afternoon.” 1
i 1
was 1
much 1
astounded 1
by 1
this 1
programme, 1
though 1
i 1
remembered 1
that 1
holmes 1
had 1
said 1
to 1
stapleton 1
on 1
the 1
night 1
before 1
that 1
his 1
visit 1
would 1
terminate 1
next 1
day. 1
it 1
had 1
not 1
crossed 1
my 1
mind 1
however, 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
wish 1
me 1
to 1
go 1
with 1
him, 1
nor 1
could 1
i 1
understand 1
how 1
we 1
could 1
both 1
be 1
absent 1
at 1
a 1
moment 1
which 1
he 1
himself 1
declared 1
to 1
be 1
critical. 1
there 1
was 1
nothing 1
for 1
it, 1
however, 1
but 1
implicit 1
obedience; 1
so 1
we 1
bade 1
good-bye 1
to 1
our 1
rueful 1
friend, 1
and 1
a 1
couple 1
of 1
hours 1
afterwards 1
we 1
were 1
at 1
the 1
station 1
of 1
coombe 1
tracey 1
and 1
had 1
dispatched 1
the 1
trap 1
upon 1
its 1
return 1
journey. 1
a 1
small 1
boy 1
was 1
waiting 1
upon 1
the 1
platform. 1
“any 1
orders, 1
sir?” 1
“you 1
will 1
take 1
this 1
train 1
to 1
town, 1
cartwright. 1
the 1
moment 1
you 1
arrive 1
you 1
will 1
send 1
a 1
wire 1
to 1
sir 1
henry 1
baskerville, 1
in 1
my 1
name, 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
if 1
he 1
finds 1
the 1
pocketbook 1
which 1
i 1
have 1
dropped 1
he 1
is 1
to 1
send 1
it 1
by 1
registered 1
post 1
to 1
baker 1
street.” 1
“yes, 1
sir.” 1
“and 1
ask 1
at 1
the 1
station 1
office 1
if 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
message 1
for 1
me.” 1
the 1
boy 1
returned 1
with 1
a 1
telegram, 1
which 1
holmes 1
handed 1
to 1
me. 1
it 1
ran: 1
wire 1
received. 1
coming 1
down 1
with 1
unsigned 1
warrant. 1
arrive 1
five-forty. 1
lestrade. 1
“that 1
is 1
in 1
answer 1
to 1
mine 1
of 1
this 1
morning. 1
he 1
is 1
the 1
best 1
of 1
the 1
professionals, 1
i 1
think, 1
and 1
we 1
may 1
need 1
his 1
assistance. 1
now, 1
watson, 1
i 1
think 1
that 1
we 1
cannot 1
employ 1
our 1
time 1
better 1
than 1
by 1
calling 1
upon 1
your 1
acquaintance, 1
mrs. 1
laura 1
lyons.” 1
his 1
plan 1
of 1
campaign 1
was 1
beginning 1
to 1
be 1
evident. 1
he 1
would 1
use 1
the 1
baronet 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
convince 1
the 1
stapletons 1
that 1
we 1
were 1
really 1
gone, 1
while 1
we 1
should 1
actually 1
return 1
at 1
the 1
instant 1
when 1
we 1
were 1
likely 1
to 1
be 1
needed. 1
that 1
telegram 1
from 1
london, 1
if 1
mentioned 1
by 1
sir 1
henry 1
to 1
the 1
stapletons, 1
must 1
remove 1
the 1
last 1
suspicions 1
from 1
their 1
minds. 1
already 1
i 1
seemed 1
to 1
see 1
our 1
nets 1
drawing 1
closer 1
around 1
that 1
lean-jawed 1
pike. 1
mrs. 1
laura 1
lyons 1
was 1
in 1
her 1
office, 1
and 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
opened 1
his 1
interview 1
with 1
a 1
frankness 1
and 1
directness 1
which 1
considerably 1
amazed 1
her. 1
“i 1
am 1
investigating 1
the 1
circumstances 1
which 1
attended 1
the 1
death 1
of 1
the 1
late 1
sir 1
charles 1
baskerville,” 1
said 1
he. 1
“my 1
friend 1
here, 1
dr. 1
watson, 1
has 1
informed 1
me 1
of 1
what 1
you 1
have 1
communicated, 1
and 1
also 1
of 1
what 1
you 1
have 1
withheld 1
in 1
connection 1
with 1
that 1
matter.” 1
“what 1
have 1
i 1
withheld?” 1
she 1
asked 1
defiantly. 1
“you 1
have 1
confessed 1
that 1
you 1
asked 1
sir 1
charles 1
to 1
be 1
at 1
the 1
gate 1
at 1
ten 1
o’clock. 1
we 1
know 1
that 1
that 1
was 1
the 1
place 1
and 1
hour 1
of 1
his 1
death. 1
you 1
have 1
withheld 1
what 1
the 1
connection 1
is 1
between 1
these 1
events.” 1
“there 1
is 1
no 1
connection.” 1
“in 1
that 1
case 1
the 1
coincidence 1
must 1
indeed 1
be 1
an 1
extraordinary 1
one. 1
but 1
i 1
think 1
that 1
we 1
shall 1
succeed 1
in 1
establishing 1
a 1
connection, 1
after 1
all. 1
i 1
wish 1
to 1
be 1
perfectly 1
frank 1
with 1
you, 1
mrs. 1
lyons. 1
we 1
regard 1
this 1
case 1
as 1
one 1
of 1
murder, 1
and 1
the 1
evidence 1
may 1
implicate 1
not 1
only 1
your 1
friend 1
mr. 1
stapleton 1
but 1
his 1
wife 1
as 1
well.” 1
the 1
lady 1
sprang 1
from 1
her 1
chair. 1
“his 1
wife!” 1
she 1
cried. 1
“the 1
fact 1
is 1
no 1
longer 1
a 1
secret. 1
the 1
person 1
who 1
has 1
passed 1
for 1
his 1
sister 1
is 1
really 1
his 1
wife.” 1
mrs. 1
lyons 1
had 1
resumed 1
her 1
seat. 1
her 1
hands 1
were 1
grasping 1
the 1
arms 1
of 1
her 1
chair, 1
and 1
i 1
saw 1
that 1
the 1
pink 1
nails 1
had 1
turned 1
white 1
with 1
the 1
pressure 1
of 1
her 1
grip. 1
“his 1
wife!” 1
she 1
said 1
again. 1
“his 1
wife! 1
he 1
is 1
not 1
a 1
married 1
man.” 1
sherlock 1
holmes 1
shrugged 1
his 1
shoulders. 1
“prove 1
it 1
to 1
me! 1
prove 1
it 1
to 1
me! 1
and 1
if 1
you 1
can 1
do 1
so—!” 1
the 1
fierce 1
flash 1
of 1
her 1
eyes 1
said 1
more 1
than 1
any 1
words. 1
“i 1
have 1
come 1
prepared 1
to 1
do 1
so,” 1
said 1
holmes, 1
drawing 1
several 1
papers 1
from 1
his 1
pocket. 1
“here 1
is 1
a 1
photograph 1
of 1
the 1
couple 1
taken 1
in 1
york 1
four 1
years 1
ago. 1
it 1
is 1
indorsed 1
‘mr. 1
and 1
mrs. 1
vandeleur,’ 1
but 1
you 1
will 1
have 1
no 1
difficulty 1
in 1
recognizing 1
him, 1
and 1
her 1
also, 1
if 1
you 1
know 1
her 1
by 1
sight. 1
here 1
are 1
three 1
written 1
descriptions 1
by 1
trustworthy 1
witnesses 1
of 1
mr. 1
and 1
mrs. 1
vandeleur, 1
who 1
at 1
that 1
time 1
kept 1
st. 1
oliver’s 1
private 1
school. 1
read 1
them 1
and 1
see 1
if 1
you 1
can 1
doubt 1
the 1
identity 1
of 1
these 1
people.” 1
she 1
glanced 1
at 1
them, 1
and 1
then 1
looked 1
up 1
at 1
us 1
with 1
the 1
set, 1
rigid 1
face 1
of 1
a 1
desperate 1
woman. 1
“mr. 1
holmes,” 1
she 1
said, 1
“this 1
man 1
had 1
offered 1
me 1
marriage 1
on 1
condition 1
that 1
i 1
could 1
get 1
a 1
divorce 1
from 1
my 1
husband. 1
he 1
has 1
lied 1
to 1
me, 1
the 1
villain, 1
in 1
every 1
conceivable 1
way. 1
not 1
one 1
word 1
of 1
truth 1
has 1
he 1
ever 1
told 1
me. 1
and 1
why—why? 1
i 1
imagined 1
that 1
all 1
was 1
for 1
my 1
own 1
sake. 1
but 1
now 1
i 1
see 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
never 1
anything 1
but 1
a 1
tool 1
in 1
his 1
hands. 1
why 1
should 1
i 1
preserve 1
faith 1
with 1
him 1
who 1
never 1
kept 1
any 1
with 1
me? 1
why 1
should 1
i 1
try 1
to 1
shield 1
him 1
from 1
the 1
consequences 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
wicked 1
acts? 1
ask 1
me 1
what 1
you 1
like, 1
and 1
there 1
is 1
nothing 1
which 1
i 1
shall 1
hold 1
back. 1
one 1
thing 1
i 1
swear 1
to 1
you, 1
and 1
that 1
is 1
that 1
when 1
i 1
wrote 1
the 1
letter 1
i 1
never 1
dreamed 1
of 1
any 1
harm 1
to 1
the 1
old 1
gentleman, 1
who 1
had 1
been 1
my 1
kindest 1
friend.” 1
“i 1
entirely 1
believe 1
you, 1
madam,” 1
said 1
sherlock 1
holmes. 1
“the 1
recital 1
of 1
these 1
events 1
must 1
be 1
very 1
painful 1
to 1
you, 1
and 1
perhaps 1
it 1
will 1
make 1
it 1
easier 1
if 1
i 1
tell 1
you 1
what 1
occurred, 1
and 1
you 1
can 1
check 1
me 1
if 1
i 1
make 1
any 1
material 1
mistake. 1
the 1
sending 1
of 1
this 1
letter 1
was 1
suggested 1
to 1
you 1
by 1
stapleton?” 1
“he 1
dictated 1
it.” 1
“i 1
presume 1
that 1
the 1
reason 1
he 1
gave 1
was 1
that 1
you 1
would 1
receive 1
help 1
from 1
sir 1
charles 1
for 1
the 1
legal 1
expenses 1
connected 1
with 1
your 1
divorce?” 1
“exactly.” 1
“and 1
then 1
after 1
you 1
had 1
sent 1
the 1
letter 1
he 1
dissuaded 1
you 1
from 1
keeping 1
the 1
appointment?” 1
“he 1
told 1
me 1
that 1
it 1
would 1
hurt 1
his 1
self-respect 1
that 1
any 1
other 1
man 1
should 1
find 1
the 1
money 1
for 1
such 1
an 1
object, 1
and 1
that 1
though 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
poor 1
man 1
himself 1
he 1
would 1
devote 1
his 1
last 1
penny 1
to 1
removing 1
the 1
obstacles 1
which 1
divided 1
us.” 1
“he 1
appears 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
very 1
consistent 1
character. 1
and 1
then 1
you 1
heard 1
nothing 1
until 1
you 1
read 1
the 1
reports 1
of 1
the 1
death 1
in 1
the 1
paper?” 1
“no.” 1
“and 1
he 1
made 1
you 1
swear 1
to 1
say 1
nothing 1
about 1
your 1
appointment 1
with 1
sir 1
charles?” 1
“he 1
did. 1
he 1
said 1
that 1
the 1
death 1
was 1
a 1
very 1
mysterious 1
one, 1
and 1
that 1
i 1
should 1
certainly 1
be 1
suspected 1
if 1
the 1
facts 1
came 1
out. 1
he 1
frightened 1
me 1
into 1
remaining 1
silent.” 1
“quite 1
so. 1
but 1
you 1
had 1
your 1
suspicions?” 1
she 1
hesitated 1
and 1
looked 1
down. 1
“i 1
knew 1
him,” 1
she 1
said. 1
“but 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
kept 1
faith 1
with 1
me 1
i 1
should 1
always 1
have 1
done 1
so 1
with 1
him.” 1
“i 1
think 1
that 1
on 1
the 1
whole 1
you 1
have 1
had 1
a 1
fortunate 1
escape,” 1
said 1
sherlock 1
holmes. 1
“you 1
have 1
had 1
him 1
in 1
your 1
power 1
and 1
he 1
knew 1
it, 1
and 1
yet 1
you 1
are 1
alive. 1
you 1
have 1
been 1
walking 1
for 1
some 1
months 1
very 1
near 1
to 1
the 1
edge 1
of 1
a 1
precipice. 1
we 1
must 1
wish 1
you 1
good-morning 1
now, 1
mrs. 1
lyons, 1
and 1
it 1
is 1
probable 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
very 1
shortly 1
hear 1
from 1
us 1
again.” 1
“our 1
case 1
becomes 1
rounded 1
off, 1
and 1
difficulty 1
after 1
difficulty 1
thins 1
away 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
us,” 1
said 1
holmes 1
as 1
we 1
stood 1
waiting 1
for 1
the 1
arrival 1
of 1
the 1
express 1
from 1
town. 1
“i 1
shall 1
soon 1
be 1
in 1
the 1
position 1
of 1
being 1
able 1
to 1
put 1
into 1
a 1
single 1
connected 1
narrative 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
singular 1
and 1
sensational 1
crimes 1
of 1
modern 1
times. 1
students 1
of 1
criminology 1
will 1
remember 1
the 1
analogous 1
incidents 1
in 1
godno, 1
in 1
little 1
russia, 1
in 1
the 1
year 1
’66, 1
and 1
of 1
course 1
there 1
are 1
the 1
anderson 1
murders 1
in 1
north 1
carolina, 1
but 1
this 1
case 1
possesses 1
some 1
features 1
which 1
are 1
entirely 1
its 1
own. 1
even 1
now 1
we 1
have 1
no 1
clear 1
case 1
against 1
this 1
very 1
wily 1
man. 1
but 1
i 1
shall 1
be 1
very 1
much 1
surprised 1
if 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
clear 1
enough 1
before 1
we 1
go 1
to 1
bed 1
this 1
night.” 1
the 1
london 1
express 1
came 1
roaring 1
into 1
the 1
station, 1
and 1
a 1
small, 1
wiry 1
bulldog 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
had 1
sprung 1
from 1
a 1
first-class 1
carriage. 1
we 1
all 1
three 1
shook 1
hands, 1
and 1
i 1
saw 1
at 1
once 1
from 1
the 1
reverential 1
way 1
in 1
which 1
lestrade 1
gazed 1
at 1
my 1
companion 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
learned 1
a 1
good 1
deal 1
since 1
the 1
days 1
when 1
they 1
had 1
first 1
worked 1
together. 1
i 1
could 1
well 1
remember 1
the 1
scorn 1
which 1
the 1
theories 1
of 1
the 1
reasoner 1
used 1
then 1
to 1
excite 1
in 1
the 1
practical 1
man. 1
“anything 1
good?” 1
he 1
asked. 1
“the 1
biggest 1
thing 1
for 1
years,” 1
said 1
holmes. 1
“we 1
have 1
two 1
hours 1
before 1
we 1
need 1
think 1
of 1
starting. 1
i 1
think 1
we 1
might 1
employ 1
it 1
in 1
getting 1
some 1
dinner 1
and 1
then, 1
lestrade, 1
we 1
will 1
take 1
the 1
london 1
fog 1
out 1
of 1
your 1
throat 1
by 1
giving 1
you 1
a 1
breath 1
of 1
the 1
pure 1
night 1
air 1
of 1
dartmoor. 1
never 1
been 1
there? 1
ah, 1
well, 1
i 1
don’t 1
suppose 1
you 1
will 1
forget 1
your 1
first 1
visit.” 1
chapter 1
14. 1
the 1
hound 1
of 1
the 1
baskervilles 1
one 1
of 1
sherlock 1
holmes’s 1
defects—if, 1
indeed, 1
one 1
may 1
call 1
it 1
a 1
defect—was 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
exceedingly 1
loath 1
to 1
communicate 1
his 1
full 1
plans 1
to 1
any 1
other 1
person 1
until 1
the 1
instant 1
of 1
their 1
fulfilment. 1
partly 1
it 1
came 1
no 1
doubt 1
from 1
his 1
own 1
masterful 1
nature, 1
which 1
loved 1
to 1
dominate 1
and 1
surprise 1
those 1
who 1
were 1
around 1
him. 1
partly 1
also 1
from 1
his 1
professional 1
caution, 1
which 1
urged 1
him 1
never 1
to 1
take 1
any 1
chances. 1
the 1
result, 1
however, 1
was 1
very 1
trying 1
for 1
those 1
who 1
were 1
acting 1
as 1
his 1
agents 1
and 1
assistants. 1
i 1
had 1
often 1
suffered 1
under 1
it, 1
but 1
never 1
more 1
so 1
than 1
during 1
that 1
long 1
drive 1
in 1
the 1
darkness. 1
the 1
great 1
ordeal 1
was 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
us; 1
at 1
last 1
we 1
were 1
about 1
to 1
make 1
our 1
final 1
effort, 1
and 1
yet 1
holmes 1
had 1
said 1
nothing, 1
and 1
i 1
could 1
only 1
surmise 1
what 1
his 1
course 1
of 1
action 1
would 1
be. 1
my 1
nerves 1
thrilled 1
with 1
anticipation 1
when 1
at 1
last 1
the 1
cold 1
wind 1
upon 1
our 1
faces 1
and 1
the 1
dark, 1
void 1
spaces 1
on 1
either 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
narrow 1
road 1
told 1
me 1
that 1
we 1
were 1
back 1
upon 1
the 1
moor 1
once 1
again. 1
every 1
stride 1
of 1
the 1
horses 1
and 1
every 1
turn 1
of 1
the 1
wheels 1
was 1
taking 1
us 1
nearer 1
to 1
our 1
supreme 1
adventure. 1
our 1
conversation 1
was 1
hampered 1
by 1
the 1
presence 1
of 1
the 1
driver 1
of 1
the 1
hired 1
wagonette, 1
so 1
that 1
we 1
were 1
forced 1
to 1
talk 1
of 1
trivial 1
matters 1
when 1
our 1
nerves 1
were 1
tense 1
with 1
emotion 1
and 1
anticipation. 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
relief 1
to 1
me, 1
after 1
that 1
unnatural 1
restraint, 1
when 1
we 1
at 1
last 1
passed 1
frankland’s 1
house 1
and 1
knew 1
that 1
we 1
were 1
drawing 1
near 1
to 1
the 1
hall 1
and 1
to 1
the 1
scene 1
of 1
action. 1
we 1
did 1
not 1
drive 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
door 1
but 1
got 1
down 1
near 1
the 1
gate 1
of 1
the 1
avenue. 1
the 1
wagonette 1
was 1
paid 1
off 1
and 1
ordered 1
to 1
return 1
to 1
coombe 1
tracey 1
forthwith, 1
while 1
we 1
started 1
to 1
walk 1
to 1
merripit 1
house. 1
“are 1
you 1
armed, 1
lestrade?” 1
the 1
little 1
detective 1
smiled. 1
“as 1
long 1
as 1
i 1
have 1
my 1
trousers 1
i 1
have 1
a 1
hip-pocket, 1
and 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
i 1
have 1
my 1
hip-pocket 1
i 1
have 1
something 1
in 1
it.” 1
“good! 1
my 1
friend 1
and 1
i 1
are 1
also 1
ready 1
for 1
emergencies.” 1
“you’re 1
mighty 1
close 1
about 1
this 1
affair, 1
mr. 1
holmes. 1
what’s 1
the 1
game 1
now?” 1
“a 1
waiting 1
game.” 1
“my 1
word, 1
it 1
does 1
not 1
seem 1
a 1
very 1
cheerful 1
place,” 1
said 1
the 1
detective 1
with 1
a 1
shiver, 1
glancing 1
round 1
him 1
at 1
the 1
gloomy 1
slopes 1
of 1
the 1
hill 1
and 1
at 1
the 1
huge 1
lake 1
of 1
fog 1
which 1
lay 1
over 1
the 1
grimpen 1
mire. 1
“i 1
see 1
the 1
lights 1
of 1
a 1
house 1
ahead 1
of 1
us.” 1
“that 1
is 1
merripit 1
house 1
and 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
our 1
journey. 1
i 1
must 1
request 1
you 1
to 1
walk 1
on 1
tiptoe 1
and 1
not 1
to 1
talk 1
above 1
a 1
whisper.” 1
we 1
moved 1
cautiously 1
along 1
the 1
track 1
as 1
if 1
we 1
were 1
bound 1
for 1
the 1
house, 1
but 1
holmes 1
halted 1
us 1
when 1
we 1
were 1
about 1
two 1
hundred 1
yards 1
from 1
it. 1
“this 1
will 1
do,” 1
said 1
he. 1
“these 1
rocks 1
upon 1
the 1
right 1
make 1
an 1
admirable 1
screen.” 1
“we 1
are 1
to 1
wait 1
here?” 1
“yes, 1
we 1
shall 1
make 1
our 1
little 1
ambush 1
here. 1
get 1
into 1
this 1
hollow, 1
lestrade. 1
you 1
have 1
been 1
inside 1
the 1
house, 1
have 1
you 1
not, 1
watson? 1
can 1
you 1
tell 1
the 1
position 1
of 1
the 1
rooms? 1
what 1
are 1
those 1
latticed 1
windows 1
at 1
this 1
end?” 1
“i 1
think 1
they 1
are 1
the 1
kitchen 1
windows.” 1
“and 1
the 1
one 1
beyond, 1
which 1
shines 1
so 1
brightly?” 1
“that 1
is 1
certainly 1
the 1
dining-room.” 1
“the 1
blinds 1
are 1
up. 1
you 1
know 1
the 1
lie 1
of 1
the 1
land 1
best. 1
creep 1
forward 1
quietly 1
and 1
see 1
what 1
they 1
are 1
doing—but 1
for 1
heaven’s 1
sake 1
don’t 1
let 1
them 1
know 1
that 1
they 1
are 1
watched!” 1
i 1
tiptoed 1
down 1
the 1
path 1
and 1
stooped 1
behind 1
the 1
low 1
wall 1
which 1
surrounded 1
the 1
stunted 1
orchard. 1
creeping 1
in 1
its 1
shadow 1
i 1
reached 1
a 1
point 1
whence 1
i 1
could 1
look 1
straight 1
through 1
the 1
uncurtained 1
window. 1
there 1
were 1
only 1
two 1
men 1
in 1
the 1
room, 1
sir 1
henry 1
and 1
stapleton. 1
they 1
sat 1
with 1
their 1
profiles 1
towards 1
me 1
on 1
either 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
round 1
table. 1
both 1
of 1
them 1
were 1
smoking 1
cigars, 1
and 1
coffee 1
and 1
wine 1
were 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
them. 1
stapleton 1
was 1
talking 1
with 1
animation, 1
but 1
the 1
baronet 1
looked 1
pale 1
and 1
distrait. 1
perhaps 1
the 1
thought 1
of 1
that 1
lonely 1
walk 1
across 1
the 1
ill-omened 1
moor 1
was 1
weighing 1
heavily 1
upon 1
his 1
mind. 1
as 1
i 1
watched 1
them 1
stapleton 1
rose 1
and 1
left 1
the 1
room, 1
while 1
sir 1
henry 1
filled 1
his 1
glass 1
again 1
and 1
leaned 1
back 1
in 1
his 1
chair, 1
puffing 1
at 1
his 1
cigar. 1
i 1
heard 1
the 1
creak 1
of 1
a 1
door 1
and 1
the 1
crisp 1
sound 1
of 1
boots 1
upon 1
gravel. 1
the 1
steps 1
passed 1
along 1
the 1
path 1
on 1
the 1
other 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
wall 1
under 1
which 1
i 1
crouched. 1
looking 1
over, 1
i 1
saw 1
the 1
naturalist 1
pause 1
at 1
the 1
door 1
of 1
an 1
out-house 1
in 1
the 1
corner 1
of 1
the 1
orchard. 1
a 1
key 1
turned 1
in 1
a 1
lock, 1
and 1
as 1
he 1
passed 1
in 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
curious 1
scuffling 1
noise 1
from 1
within. 1
he 1
was 1
only 1
a 1
minute 1
or 1
so 1
inside, 1
and 1
then 1
i 1
heard 1
the 1
key 1
turn 1
once 1
more 1
and 1
he 1
passed 1
me 1
and 1
reentered 1
the 1
house. 1
i 1
saw 1
him 1
rejoin 1
his 1
guest, 1
and 1
i 1
crept 1
quietly 1
back 1
to 1
where 1
my 1
companions 1
were 1
waiting 1
to 1
tell 1
them 1
what 1
i 1
had 1
seen. 1
“you 1
say, 1
watson, 1
that 1
the 1
lady 1
is 1
not 1
there?” 1
holmes 1
asked 1
when 1
i 1
had 1
finished 1
my 1
report. 1
“no.” 1
“where 1
can 1
she 1
be, 1
then, 1
since 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
light 1
in 1
any 1
other 1
room 1
except 1
the 1
kitchen?” 1
“i 1
cannot 1
think 1
where 1
she 1
is.” 1
i 1
have 1
said 1
that 1
over 1
the 1
great 1
grimpen 1
mire 1
there 1
hung 1
a 1
dense, 1
white 1
fog. 1
it 1
was 1
drifting 1
slowly 1
in 1
our 1
direction 1
and 1
banked 1
itself 1
up 1
like 1
a 1
wall 1
on 1
that 1
side 1
of 1
us, 1
low 1
but 1
thick 1
and 1
well 1
defined. 1
the 1
moon 1
shone 1
on 1
it, 1
and 1
it 1
looked 1
like 1
a 1
great 1
shimmering 1
ice-field, 1
with 1
the 1
heads 1
of 1
the 1
distant 1
tors 1
as 1
rocks 1
borne 1
upon 1
its 1
surface. 1
holmes’s 1
face 1
was 1
turned 1
towards 1
it, 1
and 1
he 1
muttered 1
impatiently 1
as 1
he 1
watched 1
its 1
sluggish 1
drift. 1
“it’s 1
moving 1
towards 1
us, 1
watson.” 1
“is 1
that 1
serious?” 1
“very 1
serious, 1
indeed—the 1
one 1
thing 1
upon 1
earth 1
which 1
could 1
have 1
disarranged 1
my 1
plans. 1
he 1
can’t 1
be 1
very 1
long, 1
now. 1
it 1
is 1
already 1
ten 1
o’clock. 1
our 1
success 1
and 1
even 1
his 1
life 1
may 1
depend 1
upon 1
his 1
coming 1
out 1
before 1
the 1
fog 1
is 1
over 1
the 1
path.” 1
the 1
night 1
was 1
clear 1
and 1
fine 1
above 1
us. 1
the 1
stars 1
shone 1
cold 1
and 1
bright, 1
while 1
a 1
half-moon 1
bathed 1
the 1
whole 1
scene 1
in 1
a 1
soft, 1
uncertain 1
light. 1
before 1
us 1
lay 1
the 1
dark 1
bulk 1
of 1
the 1
house, 1
its 1
serrated 1
roof 1
and 1
bristling 1
chimneys 1
hard 1
outlined 1
against 1
the 1
silver-spangled 1
sky. 1
broad 1
bars 1
of 1
golden 1
light 1
from 1
the 1
lower 1
windows 1
stretched 1
across 1
the 1
orchard 1
and 1
the 1
moor. 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
was 1
suddenly 1
shut 1
off. 1
the 1
servants 1
had 1
left 1
the 1
kitchen. 1
there 1
only 1
remained 1
the 1
lamp 1
in 1
the 1
dining-room 1
where 1
the 1
two 1
men, 1
the 1
murderous 1
host 1
and 1
the 1
unconscious 1
guest, 1
still 1
chatted 1
over 1
their 1
cigars. 1
every 1
minute 1
that 1
white 1
woolly 1
plain 1
which 1
covered 1
one-half 1
of 1
the 1
moor 1
was 1
drifting 1
closer 1
and 1
closer 1
to 1
the 1
house. 1
already 1
the 1
first 1
thin 1
wisps 1
of 1
it 1
were 1
curling 1
across 1
the 1
golden 1
square 1
of 1
the 1
lighted 1
window. 1
the 1
farther 1
wall 1
of 1
the 1
orchard 1
was 1
already 1
invisible, 1
and 1
the 1
trees 1
were 1
standing 1
out 1
of 1
a 1
swirl 1
of 1
white 1
vapour. 1
as 1
we 1
watched 1
it 1
the 1
fog-wreaths 1
came 1
crawling 1
round 1
both 1
corners 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
rolled 1
slowly 1
into 1
one 1
dense 1
bank 1
on 1
which 1
the 1
upper 1
floor 1
and 1
the 1
roof 1
floated 1
like 1
a 1
strange 1
ship 1
upon 1
a 1
shadowy 1
sea. 1
holmes 1
struck 1
his 1
hand 1
passionately 1
upon 1
the 1
rock 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
us 1
and 1
stamped 1
his 1
feet 1
in 1
his 1
impatience. 1
“if 1
he 1
isn’t 1
out 1
in 1
a 1
quarter 1
of 1
an 1
hour 1
the 1
path 1
will 1
be 1
covered. 1
in 1
half 1
an 1
hour 1
we 1
won’t 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
see 1
our 1
hands 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
us.” 1
“shall 1
we 1
move 1
farther 1
back 1
upon 1
higher 1
ground?” 1
“yes, 1
i 1
think 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
as 1
well.” 1
so 1
as 1
the 1
fog-bank 1
flowed 1
onward 1
we 1
fell 1
back 1
before 1
it 1
until 1
we 1
were 1
half 1
a 1
mile 1
from 1
the 1
house, 1
and 1
still 1
that 1
dense 1
white 1
sea, 1
with 1
the 1
moon 1
silvering 1
its 1
upper 1
edge, 1
swept 1
slowly 1
and 1
inexorably 1
on. 1
“we 1
are 1
going 1
too 1
far,” 1
said 1
holmes. 1
“we 1
dare 1
not 1
take 1
the 1
chance 1
of 1
his 1
being 1
overtaken 1
before 1
he 1
can 1
reach 1
us. 1
at 1
all 1
costs 1
we 1
must 1
hold 1
our 1
ground 1
where 1
we 1
are.” 1
he 1
dropped 1
on 1
his 1
knees 1
and 1
clapped 1
his 1
ear 1
to 1
the 1
ground. 1
“thank 1
god, 1
i 1
think 1
that 1
i 1
hear 1
him 1
coming.” 1
a 1
sound 1
of 1
quick 1
steps 1
broke 1
the 1
silence 1
of 1
the 1
moor. 1
crouching 1
among 1
the 1
stones 1
we 1
stared 1
intently 1
at 1
the 1
silver-tipped 1
bank 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
us. 1
the 1
steps 1
grew 1
louder, 1
and 1
through 1
the 1
fog, 1
as 1
through 1
a 1
curtain, 1
there 1
stepped 1
the 1
man 1
whom 1
we 1
were 1
awaiting. 1
he 1
looked 1
round 1
him 1
in 1
surprise 1
as 1
he 1
emerged 1
into 1
the 1
clear, 1
starlit 1
night. 1
then 1
he 1
came 1
swiftly 1
along 1
the 1
path, 1
passed 1
close 1
to 1
where 1
we 1
lay, 1
and 1
went 1
on 1
up 1
the 1
long 1
slope 1
behind 1
us. 1
as 1
he 1
walked 1
he 1
glanced 1
continually 1
over 1
either 1
shoulder, 1
like 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
is 1
ill 1
at 1
ease. 1
“hist!” 1
cried 1
holmes, 1
and 1
i 1
heard 1
the 1
sharp 1
click 1
of 1
a 1
cocking 1
pistol. 1
“look 1
out! 1
it’s 1
coming!” 1
there 1
was 1
a 1
thin, 1
crisp, 1
continuous 1
patter 1
from 1
somewhere 1
in 1
the 1
heart 1
of 1
that 1
crawling 1
bank. 1
the 1
cloud 1
was 1
within 1
fifty 1
yards 1
of 1
where 1
we 1
lay, 1
and 1
we 1
glared 1
at 1
it, 1
all 1
three, 1
uncertain 1
what 1
horror 1
was 1
about 1
to 1
break 1
from 1
the 1
heart 1
of 1
it. 1
i 1
was 1
at 1
holmes’s 1
elbow, 1
and 1
i 1
glanced 1
for 1
an 1
instant 1
at 1
his 1
face. 1
it 1
was 1
pale 1
and 1
exultant, 1
his 1
eyes 1
shining 1
brightly 1
in 1
the 1
moonlight. 1
but 1
suddenly 1
they 1
started 1
forward 1
in 1
a 1
rigid, 1
fixed 1
stare, 1
and 1
his 1
lips 1
parted 1
in 1
amazement. 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
instant 1
lestrade 1
gave 1
a 1
yell 1
of 1
terror 1
and 1
threw 1
himself 1
face 1
downward 1
upon 1
the 1
ground. 1
i 1
sprang 1
to 1
my 1
feet, 1
my 1
inert 1
hand 1
grasping 1
my 1
pistol, 1
my 1
mind 1
paralyzed 1
by 1
the 1
dreadful 1
shape 1
which 1
had 1
sprung 1
out 1
upon 1
us 1
from 1
the 1
shadows 1
of 1
the 1
fog. 1
a 1
hound 1
it 1
was, 1
an 1
enormous 1
coal-black 1
hound, 1
but 1
not 1
such 1
a 1
hound 1
as 1
mortal 1
eyes 1
have 1
ever 1
seen. 1
fire 1
burst 1
from 1
its 1
open 1
mouth, 1
its 1
eyes 1
glowed 1
with 1
a 1
smouldering 1
glare, 1
its 1
muzzle 1
and 1
hackles 1
and 1
dewlap 1
were 1
outlined 1
in 1
flickering 1
flame. 1
never 1
in 1
the 1
delirious 1
dream 1
of 1
a 1
disordered 1
brain 1
could 1
anything 1
more 1
savage, 1
more 1
appalling, 1
more 1
hellish 1
be 1
conceived 1
than 1
that 1
dark 1
form 1
and 1
savage 1
face 1
which 1
broke 1
upon 1
us 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
wall 1
of 1
fog. 1
with 1
long 1
bounds 1
the 1
huge 1
black 1
creature 1
was 1
leaping 1
down 1
the 1
track, 1
following 1
hard 1
upon 1
the 1
footsteps 1
of 1
our 1
friend. 1
so 1
paralyzed 1
were 1
we 1
by 1
the 1
apparition 1
that 1
we 1
allowed 1
him 1
to 1
pass 1
before 1
we 1
had 1
recovered 1
our 1
nerve. 1
then 1
holmes 1
and 1
i 1
both 1
fired 1
together, 1
and 1
the 1
creature 1
gave 1
a 1
hideous 1
howl, 1
which 1
showed 1
that 1
one 1
at 1
least 1
had 1
hit 1
him. 1
he 1
did 1
not 1
pause, 1
however, 1
but 1
bounded 1
onward. 1
far 1
away 1
on 1
the 1
path 1
we 1
saw 1
sir 1
henry 1
looking 1
back, 1
his 1
face 1
white 1
in 1
the 1
moonlight, 1
his 1
hands 1
raised 1
in 1
horror, 1
glaring 1
helplessly 1
at 1
the 1
frightful 1
thing 1
which 1
was 1
hunting 1
him 1
down. 1
but 1
that 1
cry 1
of 1
pain 1
from 1
the 1
hound 1
had 1
blown 1
all 1
our 1
fears 1
to 1
the 1
winds. 1
if 1
he 1
was 1
vulnerable 1
he 1
was 1
mortal, 1
and 1
if 1
we 1
could 1
wound 1
him 1
we 1
could 1
kill 1
him. 1
never 1
have 1
i 1
seen 1
a 1
man 1
run 1
as 1
holmes 1
ran 1
that 1
night. 1
i 1
am 1
reckoned 1
fleet 1
of 1
foot, 1
but 1
he 1
outpaced 1
me 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
i 1
outpaced 1
the 1
little 1
professional. 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
us 1
as 1
we 1
flew 1
up 1
the 1
track 1
we 1
heard 1
scream 1
after 1
scream 1
from 1
sir 1
henry 1
and 1
the 1
deep 1
roar 1
of 1
the 1
hound. 1
i 1
was 1
in 1
time 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
beast 1
spring 1
upon 1
its 1
victim, 1
hurl 1
him 1
to 1
the 1
ground, 1
and 1
worry 1
at 1
his 1
throat. 1
but 1
the 1
next 1
instant 1
holmes 1
had 1
emptied 1
five 1
barrels 1
of 1
his 1
revolver 1
into 1
the 1
creature’s 1
flank. 1
with 1
a 1
last 1
howl 1
of 1
agony 1
and 1
a 1
vicious 1
snap 1
in 1
the 1
air, 1
it 1
rolled 1
upon 1
its 1
back, 1
four 1
feet 1
pawing 1
furiously, 1
and 1
then 1
fell 1
limp 1
upon 1
its 1
side. 1
i 1
stooped, 1
panting, 1
and 1
pressed 1
my 1
pistol 1
to 1
the 1
dreadful, 1
shimmering 1
head, 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
useless 1
to 1
press 1
the 1
trigger. 1
the 1
giant 1
hound 1
was 1
dead. 1
sir 1
henry 1
lay 1
insensible 1
where 1
he 1
had 1
fallen. 1
we 1
tore 1
away 1
his 1
collar, 1
and 1
holmes 1
breathed 1
a 1
prayer 1
of 1
gratitude 1
when 1
we 1
saw 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
sign 1
of 1
a 1
wound 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
rescue 1
had 1
been 1
in 1
time. 1
already 1
our 1
friend’s 1
eyelids 1
shivered 1
and 1
he 1
made 1
a 1
feeble 1
effort 1
to 1
move. 1
lestrade 1
thrust 1
his 1
brandy-flask 1
between 1
the 1
baronet’s 1
teeth, 1
and 1
two 1
frightened 1
eyes 1
were 1
looking 1
up 1
at 1
us. 1
“my 1
god!” 1
he 1
whispered. 1
“what 1
was 1
it? 1
what, 1
in 1
heaven’s 1
name, 1
was 1
it?” 1
“it’s 1
dead, 1
whatever 1
it 1
is,” 1
said 1
holmes. 1
“we’ve 1
laid 1
the 1
family 1
ghost 1
once 1
and 1
forever.” 1
in 1
mere 1
size 1
and 1
strength 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
terrible 1
creature 1
which 1
was 1
lying 1
stretched 1
before 1
us. 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
a 1
pure 1
bloodhound 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
a 1
pure 1
mastiff; 1
but 1
it 1
appeared 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
combination 1
of 1
the 1
two—gaunt, 1
savage, 1
and 1
as 1
large 1
as 1
a 1
small 1
lioness. 1
even 1
now 1
in 1
the 1
stillness 1
of 1
death, 1
the 1
huge 1
jaws 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
dripping 1
with 1
a 1
bluish 1
flame 1
and 1
the 1
small, 1
deep-set, 1
cruel 1
eyes 1
were 1
ringed 1
with 1
fire. 1
i 1
placed 1
my 1
hand 1
upon 1
the 1
glowing 1
muzzle, 1
and 1
as 1
i 1
held 1
them 1
up 1
my 1
own 1
fingers 1
smouldered 1
and 1
gleamed 1
in 1
the 1
darkness. 1
“phosphorus,” 1
i 1
said. 1
“a 1
cunning 1
preparation 1
of 1
it,” 1
said 1
holmes, 1
sniffing 1
at 1
the 1
dead 1
animal. 1
“there 1
is 1
no 1
smell 1
which 1
might 1
have 1
interfered 1
with 1
his 1
power 1
of 1
scent. 1
we 1
owe 1
you 1
a 1
deep 1
apology, 1
sir 1
henry, 1
for 1
having 1
exposed 1
you 1
to 1
this 1
fright. 1
i 1
was 1
prepared 1
for 1
a 1
hound, 1
but 1
not 1
for 1
such 1
a 1
creature 1
as 1
this. 1
and 1
the 1
fog 1
gave 1
us 1
little 1
time 1
to 1
receive 1
him.” 1
“you 1
have 1
saved 1
my 1
life.” 1
“having 1
first 1
endangered 1
it. 1
are 1
you 1
strong 1
enough 1
to 1
stand?” 1
“give 1
me 1
another 1
mouthful 1
of 1
that 1
brandy 1
and 1
i 1
shall 1
be 1
ready 1
for 1
anything. 1
so! 1
now, 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
help 1
me 1
up. 1
what 1
do 1
you 1
propose 1
to 1
do?” 1
“to 1
leave 1
you 1
here. 1
you 1
are 1
not 1
fit 1
for 1
further 1
adventures 1
tonight. 1
if 1
you 1
will 1
wait, 1
one 1
or 1
other 1
of 1
us 1
will 1
go 1
back 1
with 1
you 1
to 1
the 1
hall.” 1
he 1
tried 1
to 1
stagger 1
to 1
his 1
feet; 1
but 1
he 1
was 1
still 1
ghastly 1
pale 1
and 1
trembling 1
in 1
every 1
limb. 1
we 1
helped 1
him 1
to 1
a 1
rock, 1
where 1
he 1
sat 1
shivering 1
with 1
his 1
face 1
buried 1
in 1
his 1
hands. 1
“we 1
must 1
leave 1
you 1
now,” 1
said 1
holmes. 1
“the 1
rest 1
of 1
our 1
work 1
must 1
be 1
done, 1
and 1
every 1
moment 1
is 1
of 1
importance. 1
we 1
have 1
our 1
case, 1
and 1
now 1
we 1
only 1
want 1
our 1
man. 1
“it’s 1
a 1
thousand 1
to 1
one 1
against 1
our 1
finding 1
him 1
at 1
the 1
house,” 1
he 1
continued 1
as 1
we 1
retraced 1
our 1
steps 1
swiftly 1
down 1
the 1
path. 1
“those 1
shots 1
must 1
have 1
told 1
him 1
that 1
the 1
game 1
was 1
up.” 1
“we 1
were 1
some 1
distance 1
off, 1
and 1
this 1
fog 1
may 1
have 1
deadened 1
them.” 1
“he 1
followed 1
the 1
hound 1
to 1
call 1
him 1
off—of 1
that 1
you 1
may 1
be 1
certain. 1
no, 1
no, 1
he’s 1
gone 1
by 1
this 1
time! 1
but 1
we’ll 1
search 1
the 1
house 1
and 1
make 1
sure.” 1
the 1
front 1
door 1
was 1
open, 1
so 1
we 1
rushed 1
in 1
and 1
hurried 1
from 1
room 1
to 1
room 1
to 1
the 1
amazement 1
of 1
a 1
doddering 1
old 1
manservant, 1
who 1
met 1
us 1
in 1
the 1
passage. 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
light 1
save 1
in 1
the 1
dining-room, 1
but 1
holmes 1
caught 1
up 1
the 1
lamp 1
and 1
left 1
no 1
corner 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
unexplored. 1
no 1
sign 1
could 1
we 1
see 1
of 1
the 1
man 1
whom 1
we 1
were 1
chasing. 1
on 1
the 1
upper 1
floor, 1
however, 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
bedroom 1
doors 1
was 1
locked. 1
“there’s 1
someone 1
in 1
here,” 1
cried 1
lestrade. 1
“i 1
can 1
hear 1
a 1
movement. 1
open 1
this 1
door!” 1
a 1
faint 1
moaning 1
and 1
rustling 1
came 1
from 1
within. 1
holmes 1
struck 1
the 1
door 1
just 1
over 1
the 1
lock 1
with 1
the 1
flat 1
of 1
his 1
foot 1
and 1
it 1
flew 1
open. 1
pistol 1
in 1
hand, 1
we 1
all 1
three 1
rushed 1
into 1
the 1
room. 1
but 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
sign 1
within 1
it 1
of 1
that 1
desperate 1
and 1
defiant 1
villain 1
whom 1
we 1
expected 1
to 1
see. 1
instead 1
we 1
were 1
faced 1
by 1
an 1
object 1
so 1
strange 1
and 1
so 1
unexpected 1
that 1
we 1
stood 1
for 1
a 1
moment 1
staring 1
at 1
it 1
in 1
amazement. 1
the 1
room 1
had 1
been 1
fashioned 1
into 1
a 1
small 1
museum, 1
and 1
the 1
walls 1
were 1
lined 1
by 1
a 1
number 1
of 1
glass-topped 1
cases 1
full 1
of 1
that 1
collection 1
of 1
butterflies 1
and 1
moths 1
the 1
formation 1
of 1
which 1
had 1
been 1
the 1
relaxation 1
of 1
this 1
complex 1
and 1
dangerous 1
man. 1
in 1
the 1
centre 1
of 1
this 1
room 1
there 1
was 1
an 1
upright 1
beam, 1
which 1
had 1
been 1
placed 1
at 1
some 1
period 1
as 1
a 1
support 1
for 1
the 1
old 1
worm-eaten 1
baulk 1
of 1
timber 1
which 1
spanned 1
the 1
roof. 1
to 1
this 1
post 1
a 1
figure 1
was 1
tied, 1
so 1
swathed 1
and 1
muffled 1
in 1
the 1
sheets 1
which 1
had 1
been 1
used 1
to 1
secure 1
it 1
that 1
one 1
could 1
not 1
for 1
the 1
moment 1
tell 1
whether 1
it 1
was 1
that 1
of 1
a 1
man 1
or 1
a 1
woman. 1
one 1
towel 1
passed 1
round 1
the 1
throat 1
and 1
was 1
secured 1
at 1
the 1
back 1
of 1
the 1
pillar. 1
another 1
covered 1
the 1
lower 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
face, 1
and 1
over 1
it 1
two 1
dark 1
eyes—eyes 1
full 1
of 1
grief 1
and 1
shame 1
and 1
a 1
dreadful 1
questioning—stared 1
back 1
at 1
us. 1
in 1
a 1
minute 1
we 1
had 1
torn 1
off 1
the 1
gag, 1
unswathed 1
the 1
bonds, 1
and 1
mrs. 1
stapleton 1
sank 1
upon 1
the 1
floor 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
us. 1
as 1
her 1
beautiful 1
head 1
fell 1
upon 1
her 1
chest 1
i 1
saw 1
the 1
clear 1
red 1
weal 1
of 1
a 1
whiplash 1
across 1
her 1
neck. 1
“the 1
brute!” 1
cried 1
holmes. 1
“here, 1
lestrade, 1
your 1
brandy-bottle! 1
put 1
her 1
in 1
the 1
chair! 1
she 1
has 1
fainted 1
from 1
ill-usage 1
and 1
exhaustion.” 1
she 1
opened 1
her 1
eyes 1
again. 1
“is 1
he 1
safe?” 1
she 1
asked. 1
“has 1
he 1
escaped?” 1
“he 1
cannot 1
escape 1
us, 1
madam.” 1
“no, 1
no, 1
i 1
did 1
not 1
mean 1
my 1
husband. 1
sir 1
henry? 1
is 1
he 1
safe?” 1
“yes.” 1
“and 1
the 1
hound?” 1
“it 1
is 1
dead.” 1
she 1
gave 1
a 1
long 1
sigh 1
of 1
satisfaction. 1
“thank 1
god! 1
thank 1
god! 1
oh, 1
this 1
villain! 1
see 1
how 1
he 1
has 1
treated 1
me!” 1
she 1
shot 1
her 1
arms 1
out 1
from 1
her 1
sleeves, 1
and 1
we 1
saw 1
with 1
horror 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
all 1
mottled 1
with 1
bruises. 1
“but 1
this 1
is 1
nothing—nothing! 1
it 1
is 1
my 1
mind 1
and 1
soul 1
that 1
he 1
has 1
tortured 1
and 1
defiled. 1
i 1
could 1
endure 1
it 1
all, 1
ill-usage, 1
solitude, 1
a 1
life 1
of 1
deception, 1
everything, 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
i 1
could 1
still 1
cling 1
to 1
the 1
hope 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
his 1
love, 1
but 1
now 1
i 1
know 1
that 1
in 1
this 1
also 1
i 1
have 1
been 1
his 1
dupe 1
and 1
his 1
tool.” 1
she 1
broke 1
into 1
passionate 1
sobbing 1
as 1
she 1
spoke. 1
“you 1
bear 1
him 1
no 1
good 1
will, 1
madam,” 1
said 1
holmes. 1
“tell 1
us 1
then 1
where 1
we 1
shall 1
find 1
him. 1
if 1
you 1
have 1
ever 1
aided 1
him 1
in 1
evil, 1
help 1
us 1
now 1
and 1
so 1
atone.” 1
“there 1
is 1
but 1
one 1
place 1
where 1
he 1
can 1
have 1
fled,” 1
she 1
answered. 1
“there 1
is 1
an 1
old 1
tin 1
mine 1
on 1
an 1
island 1
in 1
the 1
heart 1
of 1
the 1
mire. 1
it 1
was 1
there 1
that 1
he 1
kept 1
his 1
hound 1
and 1
there 1
also 1
he 1
had 1
made 1
preparations 1
so 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
have 1
a 1
refuge. 1
that 1
is 1
where 1
he 1
would 1
fly.” 1
the 1
fog-bank 1
lay 1
like 1
white 1
wool 1
against 1
the 1
window. 1
holmes 1
held 1
the 1
lamp 1
towards 1
it. 1
“see,” 1
said 1
he. 1
“no 1
one 1
could 1
find 1
his 1
way 1
into 1
the 1
grimpen 1
mire 1
tonight.” 1
she 1
laughed 1
and 1
clapped 1
her 1
hands. 1
her 1
eyes 1
and 1
teeth 1
gleamed 1
with 1
fierce 1
merriment. 1
“he 1
may 1
find 1
his 1
way 1
in, 1
but 1
never 1
out,” 1
she 1
cried. 1
“how 1
can 1
he 1
see 1
the 1
guiding 1
wands 1
tonight? 1
we 1
planted 1
them 1
together, 1
he 1
and 1
i, 1
to 1
mark 1
the 1
pathway 1
through 1
the 1
mire. 1
oh, 1
if 1
i 1
could 1
only 1
have 1
plucked 1
them 1
out 1
today. 1
then 1
indeed 1
you 1
would 1
have 1
had 1
him 1
at 1
your 1
mercy!” 1
it 1
was 1
evident 1
to 1
us 1
that 1
all 1
pursuit 1
was 1
in 1
vain 1
until 1
the 1
fog 1
had 1
lifted. 1
meanwhile 1
we 1
left 1
lestrade 1
in 1
possession 1
of 1
the 1
house 1
while 1
holmes 1
and 1
i 1
went 1
back 1
with 1
the 1
baronet 1
to 1
baskerville 1
hall. 1
the 1
story 1
of 1
the 1
stapletons 1
could 1
no 1
longer 1
be 1
withheld 1
from 1
him, 1
but 1
he 1
took 1
the 1
blow 1
bravely 1
when 1
he 1
learned 1
the 1
truth 1
about 1
the 1
woman 1
whom 1
he 1
had 1
loved. 1
but 1
the 1
shock 1
of 1
the 1
night’s 1
adventures 1
had 1
shattered 1
his 1
nerves, 1
and 1
before 1
morning 1
he 1
lay 1
delirious 1
in 1
a 1
high 1
fever 1
under 1
the 1
care 1
of 1
dr. 1
mortimer. 1
the 1
two 1
of 1
them 1
were 1
destined 1
to 1
travel 1
together 1
round 1
the 1
world 1
before 1
sir 1
henry 1
had 1
become 1
once 1
more 1
the 1
hale, 1
hearty 1
man 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
before 1
he 1
became 1
master 1
of 1
that 1
ill-omened 1
estate. 1
and 1
now 1
i 1
come 1
rapidly 1
to 1
the 1
conclusion 1
of 1
this 1
singular 1
narrative, 1
in 1
which 1
i 1
have 1
tried 1
to 1
make 1
the 1
reader 1
share 1
those 1
dark 1
fears 1
and 1
vague 1
surmises 1
which 1
clouded 1
our 1
lives 1
so 1
long 1
and 1
ended 1
in 1
so 1
tragic 1
a 1
manner. 1
on 1
the 1
morning 1
after 1
the 1
death 1
of 1
the 1
hound 1
the 1
fog 1
had 1
lifted 1
and 1
we 1
were 1
guided 1
by 1
mrs. 1
stapleton 1
to 1
the 1
point 1
where 1
they 1
had 1
found 1
a 1
pathway 1
through 1
the 1
bog. 1
it 1
helped 1
us 1
to 1
realise 1
the 1
horror 1
of 1
this 1
woman’s 1
life 1
when 1
we 1
saw 1
the 1
eagerness 1
and 1
joy 1
with 1
which 1
she 1
laid 1
us 1
on 1
her 1
husband’s 1
track. 1
we 1
left 1
her 1
standing 1
upon 1
the 1
thin 1
peninsula 1
of 1
firm, 1
peaty 1
soil 1
which 1
tapered 1
out 1
into 1
the 1
widespread 1
bog. 1
from 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
it 1
a 1
small 1
wand 1
planted 1
here 1
and 1
there 1
showed 1
where 1
the 1
path 1
zigzagged 1
from 1
tuft 1
to 1
tuft 1
of 1
rushes 1
among 1
those 1
green-scummed 1
pits 1
and 1
foul 1
quagmires 1
which 1
barred 1
the 1
way 1
to 1
the 1
stranger. 1
rank 1
reeds 1
and 1
lush, 1
slimy 1
water-plants 1
sent 1
an 1
odour 1
of 1
decay 1
and 1
a 1
heavy 1
miasmatic 1
vapour 1
onto 1
our 1
faces, 1
while 1
a 1
false 1
step 1
plunged 1
us 1
more 1
than 1
once 1
thigh-deep 1
into 1
the 1
dark, 1
quivering 1
mire, 1
which 1
shook 1
for 1
yards 1
in 1
soft 1
undulations 1
around 1
our 1
feet. 1
its 1
tenacious 1
grip 1
plucked 1
at 1
our 1
heels 1
as 1
we 1
walked, 1
and 1
when 1
we 1
sank 1
into 1
it 1
it 1
was 1
as 1
if 1
some 1
malignant 1
hand 1
was 1
tugging 1
us 1
down 1
into 1
those 1
obscene 1
depths, 1
so 1
grim 1
and 1
purposeful 1
was 1
the 1
clutch 1
in 1
which 1
it 1
held 1
us. 1
once 1
only 1
we 1
saw 1
a 1
trace 1
that 1
someone 1
had 1
passed 1
that 1
perilous 1
way 1
before 1
us. 1
from 1
amid 1
a 1
tuft 1
of 1
cotton 1
grass 1
which 1
bore 1
it 1
up 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
slime 1
some 1
dark 1
thing 1
was 1
projecting. 1
holmes 1
sank 1
to 1
his 1
waist 1
as 1
he 1
stepped 1
from 1
the 1
path 1
to 1
seize 1
it, 1
and 1
had 1
we 1
not 1
been 1
there 1
to 1
drag 1
him 1
out 1
he 1
could 1
never 1
have 1
set 1
his 1
foot 1
upon 1
firm 1
land 1
again. 1
he 1
held 1
an 1
old 1
black 1
boot 1
in 1
the 1
air. 1
“meyers, 1
toronto,” 1
was 1
printed 1
on 1
the 1
leather 1
inside. 1
“it 1
is 1
worth 1
a 1
mud 1
bath,” 1
said 1
he. 1
“it 1
is 1
our 1
friend 1
sir 1
henry’s 1
missing 1
boot.” 1
“thrown 1
there 1
by 1
stapleton 1
in 1
his 1
flight.” 1
“exactly. 1
he 1
retained 1
it 1
in 1
his 1
hand 1
after 1
using 1
it 1
to 1
set 1
the 1
hound 1
upon 1
the 1
track. 1
he 1
fled 1
when 1
he 1
knew 1
the 1
game 1
was 1
up, 1
still 1
clutching 1
it. 1
and 1
he 1
hurled 1
it 1
away 1
at 1
this 1
point 1
of 1
his 1
flight. 1
we 1
know 1
at 1
least 1
that 1
he 1
came 1
so 1
far 1
in 1
safety.” 1
but 1
more 1
than 1
that 1
we 1
were 1
never 1
destined 1
to 1
know, 1
though 1
there 1
was 1
much 1
which 1
we 1
might 1
surmise. 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
chance 1
of 1
finding 1
footsteps 1
in 1
the 1
mire, 1
for 1
the 1
rising 1
mud 1
oozed 1
swiftly 1
in 1
upon 1
them, 1
but 1
as 1
we 1
at 1
last 1
reached 1
firmer 1
ground 1
beyond 1
the 1
morass 1
we 1
all 1
looked 1
eagerly 1
for 1
them. 1
but 1
no 1
slightest 1
sign 1
of 1
them 1
ever 1
met 1
our 1
eyes. 1
if 1
the 1
earth 1
told 1
a 1
true 1
story, 1
then 1
stapleton 1
never 1
reached 1
that 1
island 1
of 1
refuge 1
towards 1
which 1
he 1
struggled 1
through 1
the 1
fog 1
upon 1
that 1
last 1
night. 1
somewhere 1
in 1
the 1
heart 1
of 1
the 1
great 1
grimpen 1
mire, 1
down 1
in 1
the 1
foul 1
slime 1
of 1
the 1
huge 1
morass 1
which 1
had 1
sucked 1
him 1
in, 1
this 1
cold 1
and 1
cruel-hearted 1
man 1
is 1
forever 1
buried. 1
many 1
traces 1
we 1
found 1
of 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
bog-girt 1
island 1
where 1
he 1
had 1
hid 1
his 1
savage 1
ally. 1
a 1
huge 1
driving-wheel 1
and 1
a 1
shaft 1
half-filled 1
with 1
rubbish 1
showed 1
the 1
position 1
of 1
an 1
abandoned 1
mine. 1
beside 1
it 1
were 1
the 1
crumbling 1
remains 1
of 1
the 1
cottages 1
of 1
the 1
miners, 1
driven 1
away 1
no 1
doubt 1
by 1
the 1
foul 1
reek 1
of 1
the 1
surrounding 1
swamp. 1
in 1
one 1
of 1
these 1
a 1
staple 1
and 1
chain 1
with 1
a 1
quantity 1
of 1
gnawed 1
bones 1
showed 1
where 1
the 1
animal 1
had 1
been 1
confined. 1
a 1
skeleton 1
with 1
a 1
tangle 1
of 1
brown 1
hair 1
adhering 1
to 1
it 1
lay 1
among 1
the 1
_débris_. 1
“a 1
dog!” 1
said 1
holmes. 1
“by 1
jove, 1
a 1
curly-haired 1
spaniel. 1
poor 1
mortimer 1
will 1
never 1
see 1
his 1
pet 1
again. 1
well, 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
that 1
this 1
place 1
contains 1
any 1
secret 1
which 1
we 1
have 1
not 1
already 1
fathomed. 1
he 1
could 1
hide 1
his 1
hound, 1
but 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
hush 1
its 1
voice, 1
and 1
hence 1
came 1
those 1
cries 1
which 1
even 1
in 1
daylight 1
were 1
not 1
pleasant 1
to 1
hear. 1
on 1
an 1
emergency 1
he 1
could 1
keep 1
the 1
hound 1
in 1
the 1
out-house 1
at 1
merripit, 1
but 1
it 1
was 1
always 1
a 1
risk, 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
only 1
on 1
the 1
supreme 1
day, 1
which 1
he 1
regarded 1
as 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
all 1
his 1
efforts, 1
that 1
he 1
dared 1
do 1
it. 1
this 1
paste 1
in 1
the 1
tin 1
is 1
no 1
doubt 1
the 1
luminous 1
mixture 1
with 1
which 1
the 1
creature 1
was 1
daubed. 1
it 1
was 1
suggested, 1
of 1
course, 1
by 1
the 1
story 1
of 1
the 1
family 1
hell-hound, 1
and 1
by 1
the 1
desire 1
to 1
frighten 1
old 1
sir 1
charles 1
to 1
death. 1
no 1
wonder 1
the 1
poor 1
devil 1
of 1
a 1
convict 1
ran 1
and 1
screamed, 1
even 1
as 1
our 1
friend 1
did, 1
and 1
as 1
we 1
ourselves 1
might 1
have 1
done, 1
when 1
he 1
saw 1
such 1
a 1
creature 1
bounding 1
through 1
the 1
darkness 1
of 1
the 1
moor 1
upon 1
his 1
track. 1
it 1
was 1
a 1
cunning 1
device, 1
for, 1
apart 1
from 1
the 1
chance 1
of 1
driving 1
your 1
victim 1
to 1
his 1
death, 1
what 1
peasant 1
would 1
venture 1
to 1
inquire 1
too 1
closely 1
into 1
such 1
a 1
creature 1
should 1
he 1
get 1
sight 1
of 1
it, 1
as 1
many 1
have 1
done, 1
upon 1
the 1
moor? 1
i 1
said 1
it 1
in 1
london, 1
watson, 1
and 1
i 1
say 1
it 1
again 1
now, 1
that 1
never 1
yet 1
have 1
we 1
helped 1
to 1
hunt 1
down 1
a 1
more 1
dangerous 1
man 1
than 1
he 1
who 1
is 1
lying 1
yonder”—he 1
swept 1
his 1
long 1
arm 1
towards 1
the 1
huge 1
mottled 1
expanse 1
of 1
green-splotched 1
bog 1
which 1
stretched 1
away 1
until 1
it 1
merged 1
into 1
the 1
russet 1
slopes 1
of 1
the 1
moor. 1
chapter 1
15. 1
a 1
retrospection 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
november, 1
and 1
holmes 1
and 1
i 1
sat, 1
upon 1
a 1
raw 1
and 1
foggy 1
night, 1
on 1
either 1
side 1
of 1
a 1
blazing 1
fire 1
in 1
our 1
sitting-room 1
in 1
baker 1
street. 1
since 1
the 1
tragic 1
upshot 1
of 1
our 1
visit 1
to 1
devonshire 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
engaged 1
in 1
two 1
affairs 1
of 1
the 1
utmost 1
importance, 1
in 1
the 1
first 1
of 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
exposed 1
the 1
atrocious 1
conduct 1
of 1
colonel 1
upwood 1
in 1
connection 1
with 1
the 1
famous 1
card 1
scandal 1
of 1
the 1
nonpareil 1
club, 1
while 1
in 1
the 1
second 1
he 1
had 1
defended 1
the 1
unfortunate 1
mme. 1
montpensier 1
from 1
the 1
charge 1
of 1
murder 1
which 1
hung 1
over 1
her 1
in 1
connection 1
with 1
the 1
death 1
of 1
her 1
step-daughter, 1
mlle. 1
carére, 1
the 1
young 1
lady 1
who, 1
as 1
it 1
will 1
be 1
remembered, 1
was 1
found 1
six 1
months 1
later 1
alive 1
and 1
married 1
in 1
new 1
york. 1
my 1
friend 1
was 1
in 1
excellent 1
spirits 1
over 1
the 1
success 1
which 1
had 1
attended 1
a 1
succession 1
of 1
difficult 1
and 1
important 1
cases, 1
so 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
able 1
to 1
induce 1
him 1
to 1
discuss 1
the 1
details 1
of 1
the 1
baskerville 1
mystery. 1
i 1
had 1
waited 1
patiently 1
for 1
the 1
opportunity 1
for 1
i 1
was 1
aware 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
never 1
permit 1
cases 1
to 1
overlap, 1
and 1
that 1
his 1
clear 1
and 1
logical 1
mind 1
would 1
not 1
be 1
drawn 1
from 1
its 1
present 1
work 1
to 1
dwell 1
upon 1
memories 1
of 1
the 1
past. 1
sir 1
henry 1
and 1
dr. 1
mortimer 1
were, 1
however, 1
in 1
london, 1
on 1
their 1
way 1
to 1
that 1
long 1
voyage 1
which 1
had 1
been 1
recommended 1
for 1
the 1
restoration 1
of 1
his 1
shattered 1
nerves. 1
they 1
had 1
called 1
upon 1
us 1
that 1
very 1
afternoon, 1
so 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
natural 1
that 1
the 1
subject 1
should 1
come 1
up 1
for 1
discussion. 1
“the 1
whole 1
course 1
of 1
events,” 1
said 1
holmes, 1
“from 1
the 1
point 1
of 1
view 1
of 1
the 1
man 1
who 1
called 1
himself 1
stapleton 1
was 1
simple 1
and 1
direct, 1
although 1
to 1
us, 1
who 1
had 1
no 1
means 1
in 1
the 1
beginning 1
of 1
knowing 1
the 1
motives 1
of 1
his 1
actions 1
and 1
could 1
only 1
learn 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
facts, 1
it 1
all 1
appeared 1
exceedingly 1
complex. 1
i 1
have 1
had 1
the 1
advantage 1
of 1
two 1
conversations 1
with 1
mrs. 1
stapleton, 1
and 1
the 1
case 1
has 1
now 1
been 1
so 1
entirely 1
cleared 1
up 1
that 1
i 1
am 1
not 1
aware 1
that 1
there 1
is 1
anything 1
which 1
has 1
remained 1
a 1
secret 1
to 1
us. 1
you 1
will 1
find 1
a 1
few 1
notes 1
upon 1
the 1
matter 1
under 1
the 1
heading 1
b 1
in 1
my 1
indexed 1
list 1
of 1
cases.” 1
“perhaps 1
you 1
would 1
kindly 1
give 1
me 1
a 1
sketch 1
of 1
the 1
course 1
of 1
events 1
from 1
memory.” 1
“certainly, 1
though 1
i 1
cannot 1
guarantee 1
that 1
i 1
carry 1
all 1
the 1
facts 1
in 1
my 1
mind. 1
intense 1
mental 1
concentration 1
has 1
a 1
curious 1
way 1
of 1
blotting 1
out 1
what 1
has 1
passed. 1
the 1
barrister 1
who 1
has 1
his 1
case 1
at 1
his 1
fingers’ 1
ends 1
and 1
is 1
able 1
to 1
argue 1
with 1
an 1
expert 1
upon 1
his 1
own 1
subject 1
finds 1
that 1
a 1
week 1
or 1
two 1
of 1
the 1
courts 1
will 1
drive 1
it 1
all 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
head 1
once 1
more. 1
so 1
each 1
of 1
my 1
cases 1
displaces 1
the 1
last, 1
and 1
mlle. 1
carére 1
has 1
blurred 1
my 1
recollection 1
of 1
baskerville 1
hall. 1
tomorrow 1
some 1
other 1
little 1
problem 1
may 1
be 1
submitted 1
to 1
my 1
notice 1
which 1
will 1
in 1
turn 1
dispossess 1
the 1
fair 1
french 1
lady 1
and 1
the 1
infamous 1
upwood. 1
so 1
far 1
as 1
the 1
case 1
of 1
the 1
hound 1
goes, 1
however, 1
i 1
will 1
give 1
you 1
the 1
course 1
of 1
events 1
as 1
nearly 1
as 1
i 1
can, 1
and 1
you 1
will 1
suggest 1
anything 1
which 1
i 1
may 1
have 1
forgotten. 1
“my 1
inquiries 1
show 1
beyond 1
all 1
question 1
that 1
the 1
family 1
portrait 1
did 1
not 1
lie, 1
and 1
that 1
this 1
fellow 1
was 1
indeed 1
a 1
baskerville. 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
son 1
of 1
that 1
rodger 1
baskerville, 1
the 1
younger 1
brother 1
of 1
sir 1
charles, 1
who 1
fled 1
with 1
a 1
sinister 1
reputation 1
to 1
south 1
america, 1
where 1
he 1
was 1
said 1
to 1
have 1
died 1
unmarried. 1
he 1
did, 1
as 1
a 1
matter 1
of 1
fact, 1
marry, 1
and 1
had 1
one 1
child, 1
this 1
fellow, 1
whose 1
real 1
name 1
is 1
the 1
same 1
as 1
his 1
father’s. 1
he 1
married 1
beryl 1
garcia, 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
beauties 1
of 1
costa 1
rica, 1
and, 1
having 1
purloined 1
a 1
considerable 1
sum 1
of 1
public 1
money, 1
he 1
changed 1
his 1
name 1
to 1
vandeleur 1
and 1
fled 1
to 1
england, 1
where 1
he 1
established 1
a 1
school 1
in 1
the 1
east 1
of 1
yorkshire. 1
his 1
reason 1
for 1
attempting 1
this 1
special 1
line 1
of 1
business 1
was 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
struck 1
up 1
an 1
acquaintance 1
with 1
a 1
consumptive 1
tutor 1
upon 1
the 1
voyage 1
home, 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
used 1
this 1
man’s 1
ability 1
to 1
make 1
the 1
undertaking 1
a 1
success. 1
fraser, 1
the 1
tutor, 1
died 1
however, 1
and 1
the 1
school 1
which 1
had 1
begun 1
well 1
sank 1
from 1
disrepute 1
into 1
infamy. 1
the 1
vandeleurs 1
found 1
it 1
convenient 1
to 1
change 1
their 1
name 1
to 1
stapleton, 1
and 1
he 1
brought 1
the 1
remains 1
of 1
his 1
fortune, 1
his 1
schemes 1
for 1
the 1
future, 1
and 1
his 1
taste 1
for 1
entomology 1
to 1
the 1
south 1
of 1
england. 1
i 1
learned 1
at 1
the 1
british 1
museum 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
a 1
recognized 1
authority 1
upon 1
the 1
subject, 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
vandeleur 1
has 1
been 1
permanently 1
attached 1
to 1
a 1
certain 1
moth 1
which 1
he 1
had, 1
in 1
his 1
yorkshire 1
days, 1
been 1
the 1
first 1
to 1
describe. 1
“we 1
now 1
come 1
to 1
that 1
portion 1
of 1
his 1
life 1
which 1
has 1
proved 1
to 1
be 1
of 1
such 1
intense 1
interest 1
to 1
us. 1
the 1
fellow 1
had 1
evidently 1
made 1
inquiry 1
and 1
found 1
that 1
only 1
two 1
lives 1
intervened 1
between 1
him 1
and 1
a 1
valuable 1
estate. 1
when 1
he 1
went 1
to 1
devonshire 1
his 1
plans 1
were, 1
i 1
believe, 1
exceedingly 1
hazy, 1
but 1
that 1
he 1
meant 1
mischief 1
from 1
the 1
first 1
is 1
evident 1
from 1
the 1
way 1
in 1
which 1
he 1
took 1
his 1
wife 1
with 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
character 1
of 1
his 1
sister. 1
the 1
idea 1
of 1
using 1
her 1
as 1
a 1
decoy 1
was 1
clearly 1
already 1
in 1
his 1
mind, 1
though 1
he 1
may 1
not 1
have 1
been 1
certain 1
how 1
the 1
details 1
of 1
his 1
plot 1
were 1
to 1
be 1
arranged. 1
he 1
meant 1
in 1
the 1
end 1
to 1
have 1
the 1
estate, 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
ready 1
to 1
use 1
any 1
tool 1
or 1
run 1
any 1
risk 1
for 1
that 1
end. 1
his 1
first 1
act 1
was 1
to 1
establish 1
himself 1
as 1
near 1
to 1
his 1
ancestral 1
home 1
as 1
he 1
could, 1
and 1
his 1
second 1
was 1
to 1
cultivate 1
a 1
friendship 1
with 1
sir 1
charles 1
baskerville 1
and 1
with 1
the 1
neighbours. 1
“the 1
baronet 1
himself 1
told 1
him 1
about 1
the 1
family 1
hound, 1
and 1
so 1
prepared 1
the 1
way 1
for 1
his 1
own 1
death. 1
stapleton, 1
as 1
i 1
will 1
continue 1
to 1
call 1
him, 1
knew 1
that 1
the 1
old 1
man’s 1
heart 1
was 1
weak 1
and 1
that 1
a 1
shock 1
would 1
kill 1
him. 1
so 1
much 1
he 1
had 1
learned 1
from 1
dr. 1
mortimer. 1
he 1
had 1
heard 1
also 1
that 1
sir 1
charles 1
was 1
superstitious 1
and 1
had 1
taken 1
this 1
grim 1
legend 1
very 1
seriously. 1
his 1
ingenious 1
mind 1
instantly 1
suggested 1
a 1
way 1
by 1
which 1
the 1
baronet 1
could 1
be 1
done 1
to 1
death, 1
and 1
yet 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
hardly 1
possible 1
to 1
bring 1
home 1
the 1
guilt 1
to 1
the 1
real 1
murderer. 1
“having 1
conceived 1
the 1
idea 1
he 1
proceeded 1
to 1
carry 1
it 1
out 1
with 1
considerable 1
finesse. 1
an 1
ordinary 1
schemer 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
content 1
to 1
work 1
with 1
a 1
savage 1
hound. 1
the 1
use 1
of 1
artificial 1
means 1
to 1
make 1
the 1
creature 1
diabolical 1
was 1
a 1
flash 1
of 1
genius 1
upon 1
his 1
part. 1
the 1
dog 1
he 1
bought 1
in 1
london 1
from 1
ross 1
and 1
mangles, 1
the 1
dealers 1
in 1
fulham 1
road. 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
strongest 1
and 1
most 1
savage 1
in 1
their 1
possession. 1
he 1
brought 1
it 1
down 1
by 1
the 1
north 1
devon 1
line 1
and 1
walked 1
a 1
great 1
distance 1
over 1
the 1
moor 1
so 1
as 1
to 1
get 1
it 1
home 1
without 1
exciting 1
any 1
remarks. 1
he 1
had 1
already 1
on 1
his 1
insect 1
hunts 1
learned 1
to 1
penetrate 1
the 1
grimpen 1
mire, 1
and 1
so 1
had 1
found 1
a 1
safe 1
hiding-place 1
for 1
the 1
creature. 1
here 1
he 1
kennelled 1
it 1
and 1
waited 1
his 1
chance. 1
“but 1
it 1
was 1
some 1
time 1
coming. 1
the 1
old 1
gentleman 1
could 1
not 1
be 1
decoyed 1
outside 1
of 1
his 1
grounds 1
at 1
night. 1
several 1
times 1
stapleton 1
lurked 1
about 1
with 1
his 1
hound, 1
but 1
without 1
avail. 1
it 1
was 1
during 1
these 1
fruitless 1
quests 1
that 1
he, 1
or 1
rather 1
his 1
ally, 1
was 1
seen 1
by 1
peasants, 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
legend 1
of 1
the 1
demon 1
dog 1
received 1
a 1
new 1
confirmation. 1
he 1
had 1
hoped 1
that 1
his 1
wife 1
might 1
lure 1
sir 1
charles 1
to 1
his 1
ruin, 1
but 1
here 1
she 1
proved 1
unexpectedly 1
independent. 1
she 1
would 1
not 1
endeavour 1
to 1
entangle 1
the 1
old 1
gentleman 1
in 1
a 1
sentimental 1
attachment 1
which 1
might 1
deliver 1
him 1
over 1
to 1
his 1
enemy. 1
threats 1
and 1
even, 1
i 1
am 1
sorry 1
to 1
say, 1
blows 1
refused 1
to 1
move 1
her. 1
she 1
would 1
have 1
nothing 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
it, 1
and 1
for 1
a 1
time 1
stapleton 1
was 1
at 1
a 1
deadlock. 1
“he 1
found 1
a 1
way 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
difficulties 1
through 1
the 1
chance 1
that 1
sir 1
charles, 1
who 1
had 1
conceived 1
a 1
friendship 1
for 1
him, 1
made 1
him 1
the 1
minister 1
of 1
his 1
charity 1
in 1
the 1
case 1
of 1
this 1
unfortunate 1
woman, 1
mrs. 1
laura 1
lyons. 1
by 1
representing 1
himself 1
as 1
a 1
single 1
man 1
he 1
acquired 1
complete 1
influence 1
over 1
her, 1
and 1
he 1
gave 1
her 1
to 1
understand 1
that 1
in 1
the 1
event 1
of 1
her 1
obtaining 1
a 1
divorce 1
from 1
her 1
husband 1
he 1
would 1
marry 1
her. 1
his 1
plans 1
were 1
suddenly 1
brought 1
to 1
a 1
head 1
by 1
his 1
knowledge 1
that 1
sir 1
charles 1
was 1
about 1
to 1
leave 1
the 1
hall 1
on 1
the 1
advice 1
of 1
dr. 1
mortimer, 1
with 1
whose 1
opinion 1
he 1
himself 1
pretended 1
to 1
coincide. 1
he 1
must 1
act 1
at 1
once, 1
or 1
his 1
victim 1
might 1
get 1
beyond 1
his 1
power. 1
he 1
therefore 1
put 1
pressure 1
upon 1
mrs. 1
lyons 1
to 1
write 1
this 1
letter, 1
imploring 1
the 1
old 1
man 1
to 1
give 1
her 1
an 1
interview 1
on 1
the 1
evening 1
before 1
his 1
departure 1
for 1
london. 1
he 1
then, 1
by 1
a 1
specious 1
argument, 1
prevented 1
her 1
from 1
going, 1
and 1
so 1
had 1
the 1
chance 1
for 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
waited. 1
“driving 1
back 1
in 1
the 1
evening 1
from 1
coombe 1
tracey 1
he 1
was 1
in 1
time 1
to 1
get 1
his 1
hound, 1
to 1
treat 1
it 1
with 1
his 1
infernal 1
paint, 1
and 1
to 1
bring 1
the 1
beast 1
round 1
to 1
the 1
gate 1
at 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
reason 1
to 1
expect 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
find 1
the 1
old 1
gentleman 1
waiting. 1
the 1
dog, 1
incited 1
by 1
its 1
master, 1
sprang 1
over 1
the 1
wicket-gate 1
and 1
pursued 1
the 1
unfortunate 1
baronet, 1
who 1
fled 1
screaming 1
down 1
the 1
yew 1
alley. 1
in 1
that 1
gloomy 1
tunnel 1
it 1
must 1
indeed 1
have 1
been 1
a 1
dreadful 1
sight 1
to 1
see 1
that 1
huge 1
black 1
creature, 1
with 1
its 1
flaming 1
jaws 1
and 1
blazing 1
eyes, 1
bounding 1
after 1
its 1
victim. 1
he 1
fell 1
dead 1
at 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
alley 1
from 1
heart 1
disease 1
and 1
terror. 1
the 1
hound 1
had 1
kept 1
upon 1
the 1
grassy 1
border 1
while 1
the 1
baronet 1
had 1
run 1
down 1
the 1
path, 1
so 1
that 1
no 1
track 1
but 1
the 1
man’s 1
was 1
visible. 1
on 1
seeing 1
him 1
lying 1
still 1
the 1
creature 1
had 1
probably 1
approached 1
to 1
sniff 1
at 1
him, 1
but 1
finding 1
him 1
dead 1
had 1
turned 1
away 1
again. 1
it 1
was 1
then 1
that 1
it 1
left 1
the 1
print 1
which 1
was 1
actually 1
observed 1
by 1
dr. 1
mortimer. 1
the 1
hound 1
was 1
called 1
off 1
and 1
hurried 1
away 1
to 1
its 1
lair 1
in 1
the 1
grimpen 1
mire, 1
and 1
a 1
mystery 1
was 1
left 1
which 1
puzzled 1
the 1
authorities, 1
alarmed 1
the 1
countryside, 1
and 1
finally 1
brought 1
the 1
case 1
within 1
the 1
scope 1
of 1
our 1
observation. 1
“so 1
much 1
for 1
the 1
death 1
of 1
sir 1
charles 1
baskerville. 1
you 1
perceive 1
the 1
devilish 1
cunning 1
of 1
it, 1
for 1
really 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
almost 1
impossible 1
to 1
make 1
a 1
case 1
against 1
the 1
real 1
murderer. 1
his 1
only 1
accomplice 1
was 1
one 1
who 1
could 1
never 1
give 1
him 1
away, 1
and 1
the 1
grotesque, 1
inconceivable 1
nature 1
of 1
the 1
device 1
only 1
served 1
to 1
make 1
it 1
more 1
effective. 1
both 1
of 1
the 1
women 1
concerned 1
in 1
the 1
case, 1
mrs. 1
stapleton 1
and 1
mrs. 1
laura 1
lyons, 1
were 1
left 1
with 1
a 1
strong 1
suspicion 1
against 1
stapleton. 1
mrs. 1
stapleton 1
knew 1
that 1
he 1
had 1
designs 1
upon 1
the 1
old 1
man, 1
and 1
also 1
of 1
the 1
existence 1
of 1
the 1
hound. 1
mrs. 1
lyons 1
knew 1
neither 1
of 1
these 1
things, 1
but 1
had 1
been 1
impressed 1
by 1
the 1
death 1
occurring 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
of 1
an 1
uncancelled 1
appointment 1
which 1
was 1
only 1
known 1
to 1
him. 1
however, 1
both 1
of 1
them 1
were 1
under 1
his 1
influence, 1
and 1
he 1
had 1
nothing 1
to 1
fear 1
from 1
them. 1
the 1
first 1
half 1
of 1
his 1
task 1
was 1
successfully 1
accomplished 1
but 1
the 1
more 1
difficult 1
still 1
remained. 1
“it 1
is 1
possible 1
that 1
stapleton 1
did 1
not 1
know 1
of 1
the 1
existence 1
of 1
an 1
heir 1
in 1
canada. 1
in 1
any 1
case 1
he 1
would 1
very 1
soon 1
learn 1
it 1
from 1
his 1
friend 1
dr. 1
mortimer, 1
and 1
he 1
was 1
told 1
by 1
the 1
latter 1
all 1
details 1
about 1
the 1
arrival 1
of 1
henry 1
baskerville. 1
stapleton’s 1
first 1
idea 1
was 1
that 1
this 1
young 1
stranger 1
from 1
canada 1
might 1
possibly 1
be 1
done 1
to 1
death 1
in 1
london 1
without 1
coming 1
down 1
to 1
devonshire 1
at 1
all. 1
he 1
distrusted 1
his 1
wife 1
ever 1
since 1
she 1
had 1
refused 1
to 1
help 1
him 1
in 1
laying 1
a 1
trap 1
for 1
the 1
old 1
man, 1
and 1
he 1
dared 1
not 1
leave 1
her 1
long 1
out 1
of 1
his 1
sight 1
for 1
fear 1
he 1
should 1
lose 1
his 1
influence 1
over 1
her. 1
it 1
was 1
for 1
this 1
reason 1
that 1
he 1
took 1
her 1
to 1
london 1
with 1
him. 1
they 1
lodged, 1
i 1
find, 1
at 1
the 1
mexborough 1
private 1
hotel, 1
in 1
craven 1
street, 1
which 1
was 1
actually 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
called 1
upon 1
by 1
my 1
agent 1
in 1
search 1
of 1
evidence. 1
here 1
he 1
kept 1
his 1
wife 1
imprisoned 1
in 1
her 1
room 1
while 1
he, 1
disguised 1
in 1
a 1
beard, 1
followed 1
dr. 1
mortimer 1
to 1
baker 1
street 1
and 1
afterwards 1
to 1
the 1
station 1
and 1
to 1
the 1
northumberland 1
hotel. 1
his 1
wife 1
had 1
some 1
inkling 1
of 1
his 1
plans; 1
but 1
she 1
had 1
such 1
a 1
fear 1
of 1
her 1
husband—a 1
fear 1
founded 1
upon 1
brutal 1
ill-treatment—that 1
she 1
dare 1
not 1
write 1
to 1
warn 1
the 1
man 1
whom 1
she 1
knew 1
to 1
be 1
in 1
danger. 1
if 1
the 1
letter 1
should 1
fall 1
into 1
stapleton’s 1
hands 1
her 1
own 1
life 1
would 1
not 1
be 1
safe. 1
eventually, 1
as 1
we 1
know, 1
she 1
adopted 1
the 1
expedient 1
of 1
cutting 1
out 1
the 1
words 1
which 1
would 1
form 1
the 1
message, 1
and 1
addressing 1
the 1
letter 1
in 1
a 1
disguised 1
hand. 1
it 1
reached 1
the 1
baronet, 1
and 1
gave 1
him 1
the 1
first 1
warning 1
of 1
his 1
danger. 1
“it 1
was 1
very 1
essential 1
for 1
stapleton 1
to 1
get 1
some 1
article 1
of 1
sir 1
henry’s 1
attire 1
so 1
that, 1
in 1
case 1
he 1
was 1
driven 1
to 1
use 1
the 1
dog, 1
he 1
might 1
always 1
have 1
the 1
means 1
of 1
setting 1
him 1
upon 1
his 1
track. 1
with 1
characteristic 1
promptness 1
and 1
audacity 1
he 1
set 1
about 1
this 1
at 1
once, 1
and 1
we 1
cannot 1
doubt 1
that 1
the 1
boots 1
or 1
chamber-maid 1
of 1
the 1
hotel 1
was 1
well 1
bribed 1
to 1
help 1
him 1
in 1
his 1
design. 1
by 1
chance, 1
however, 1
the 1
first 1
boot 1
which 1
was 1
procured 1
for 1
him 1
was 1
a 1
new 1
one 1
and, 1
therefore, 1
useless 1
for 1
his 1
purpose. 1
he 1
then 1
had 1
it 1
returned 1
and 1
obtained 1
another—a 1
most 1
instructive 1
incident, 1
since 1
it 1
proved 1
conclusively 1
to 1
my 1
mind 1
that 1
we 1
were 1
dealing 1
with 1
a 1
real 1
hound, 1
as 1
no 1
other 1
supposition 1
could 1
explain 1
this 1
anxiety 1
to 1
obtain 1
an 1
old 1
boot 1
and 1
this 1
indifference 1
to 1
a 1
new 1
one. 1
the 1
more 1
_outré_ 1
and 1
grotesque 1
an 1
incident 1
is 1
the 1
more 1
carefully 1
it 1
deserves 1
to 1
be 1
examined, 1
and 1
the 1
very 1
point 1
which 1
appears 1
to 1
complicate 1
a 1
case 1
is, 1
when 1
duly 1
considered 1
and 1
scientifically 1
handled, 1
the 1
one 1
which 1
is 1
most 1
likely 1
to 1
elucidate 1
it. 1
“then 1
we 1
had 1
the 1
visit 1
from 1
our 1
friends 1
next 1
morning, 1
shadowed 1
always 1
by 1
stapleton 1
in 1
the 1
cab. 1
from 1
his 1
knowledge 1
of 1
our 1
rooms 1
and 1
of 1
my 1
appearance, 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
from 1
his 1
general 1
conduct, 1
i 1
am 1
inclined 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
stapleton’s 1
career 1
of 1
crime 1
has 1
been 1
by 1
no 1
means 1
limited 1
to 1
this 1
single 1
baskerville 1
affair. 1
it 1
is 1
suggestive 1
that 1
during 1
the 1
last 1
three 1
years 1
there 1
have 1
been 1
four 1
considerable 1
burglaries 1
in 1
the 1
west 1
country, 1
for 1
none 1
of 1
which 1
was 1
any 1
criminal 1
ever 1
arrested. 1
the 1
last 1
of 1
these, 1
at 1
folkestone 1
court, 1
in 1
may, 1
was 1
remarkable 1
for 1
the 1
cold-blooded 1
pistolling 1
of 1
the 1
page, 1
who 1
surprised 1
the 1
masked 1
and 1
solitary 1
burglar. 1
i 1
cannot 1
doubt 1
that 1
stapleton 1
recruited 1
his 1
waning 1
resources 1
in 1
this 1
fashion, 1
and 1
that 1
for 1
years 1
he 1
has 1
been 1
a 1
desperate 1
and 1
dangerous 1
man. 1
“we 1
had 1
an 1
example 1
of 1
his 1
readiness 1
of 1
resource 1
that 1
morning 1
when 1
he 1
got 1
away 1
from 1
us 1
so 1
successfully, 1
and 1
also 1
of 1
his 1
audacity 1
in 1
sending 1
back 1
my 1
own 1
name 1
to 1
me 1
through 1
the 1
cabman. 1
from 1
that 1
moment 1
he 1
understood 1
that 1
i 1
had 1
taken 1
over 1
the 1
case 1
in 1
london, 1
and 1
that 1
therefore 1
there 1
was 1
no 1
chance 1
for 1
him 1
there. 1
he 1
returned 1
to 1
dartmoor 1
and 1
awaited 1
the 1
arrival 1
of 1
the 1
baronet.” 1
“one 1
moment!” 1
said 1
i. 1
“you 1
have, 1
no 1
doubt, 1
described 1
the 1
sequence 1
of 1
events 1
correctly, 1
but 1
there 1
is 1
one 1
point 1
which 1
you 1
have 1
left 1
unexplained. 1
what 1
became 1
of 1
the 1
hound 1
when 1
its 1
master 1
was 1
in 1
london?” 1
“i 1
have 1
given 1
some 1
attention 1
to 1
this 1
matter 1
and 1
it 1
is 1
undoubtedly 1
of 1
importance. 1
there 1
can 1
be 1
no 1
question 1
that 1
stapleton 1
had 1
a 1
confidant, 1
though 1
it 1
is 1
unlikely 1
that 1
he 1
ever 1
placed 1
himself 1
in 1
his 1
power 1
by 1
sharing 1
all 1
his 1
plans 1
with 1
him. 1
there 1
was 1
an 1
old 1
manservant 1
at 1
merripit 1
house, 1
whose 1
name 1
was 1
anthony. 1
his 1
connection 1
with 1
the 1
stapletons 1
can 1
be 1
traced 1
for 1
several 1
years, 1
as 1
far 1
back 1
as 1
the 1
school-mastering 1
days, 1
so 1
that 1
he 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
aware 1
that 1
his 1
master 1
and 1
mistress 1
were 1
really 1
husband 1
and 1
wife. 1
this 1
man 1
has 1
disappeared 1
and 1
has 1
escaped 1
from 1
the 1
country. 1
it 1
is 1
suggestive 1
that 1
anthony 1
is 1
not 1
a 1
common 1
name 1
in 1
england, 1
while 1
antonio 1
is 1
so 1
in 1
all 1
spanish 1
or 1
spanish-american 1
countries. 1
the 1
man, 1
like 1
mrs. 1
stapleton 1
herself, 1
spoke 1
good 1
english, 1
but 1
with 1
a 1
curious 1
lisping 1
accent. 1
i 1
have 1
myself 1
seen 1
this 1
old 1
man 1
cross 1
the 1
grimpen 1
mire 1
by 1
the 1
path 1
which 1
stapleton 1
had 1
marked 1
out. 1
it 1
is 1
very 1
probable, 1
therefore, 1
that 1
in 1
the 1
absence 1
of 1
his 1
master 1
it 1
was 1
he 1
who 1
cared 1
for 1
the 1
hound, 1
though 1
he 1
may 1
never 1
have 1
known 1
the 1
purpose 1
for 1
which 1
the 1
beast 1
was 1
used. 1
“the 1
stapletons 1
then 1
went 1
down 1
to 1
devonshire, 1
whither 1
they 1
were 1
soon 1
followed 1
by 1
sir 1
henry 1
and 1
you. 1
one 1
word 1
now 1
as 1
to 1
how 1
i 1
stood 1
myself 1
at 1
that 1
time. 1
it 1
may 1
possibly 1
recur 1
to 1
your 1
memory 1
that 1
when 1
i 1
examined 1
the 1
paper 1
upon 1
which 1
the 1
printed 1
words 1
were 1
fastened 1
i 1
made 1
a 1
close 1
inspection 1
for 1
the 1
water-mark. 1
in 1
doing 1
so 1
i 1
held 1
it 1
within 1
a 1
few 1
inches 1
of 1
my 1
eyes, 1
and 1
was 1
conscious 1
of 1
a 1
faint 1
smell 1
of 1
the 1
scent 1
known 1
as 1
white 1
jessamine. 1
there 1
are 1
seventy-five 1
perfumes, 1
which 1
it 1
is 1
very 1
necessary 1
that 1
a 1
criminal 1
expert 1
should 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
distinguish 1
from 1
each 1
other, 1
and 1
cases 1
have 1
more 1
than 1
once 1
within 1
my 1
own 1
experience 1
depended 1
upon 1
their 1
prompt 1
recognition. 1
the 1
scent 1
suggested 1
the 1
presence 1
of 1
a 1
lady, 1
and 1
already 1
my 1
thoughts 1
began 1
to 1
turn 1
towards 1
the 1
stapletons. 1
thus 1
i 1
had 1
made 1
certain 1
of 1
the 1
hound, 1
and 1
had 1
guessed 1
at 1
the 1
criminal 1
before 1
ever 1
we 1
went 1
to 1
the 1
west 1
country. 1
“it 1
was 1
my 1
game 1
to 1
watch 1
stapleton. 1
it 1
was 1
evident, 1
however, 1
that 1
i 1
could 1
not 1
do 1
this 1
if 1
i 1
were 1
with 1
you, 1
since 1
he 1
would 1
be 1
keenly 1
on 1
his 1
guard. 1
i 1
deceived 1
everybody, 1
therefore, 1
yourself 1
included, 1
and 1
i 1
came 1
down 1
secretly 1
when 1
i 1
was 1
supposed 1
to 1
be 1
in 1
london. 1
my 1
hardships 1
were 1
not 1
so 1
great 1
as 1
you 1
imagined, 1
though 1
such 1
trifling 1
details 1
must 1
never 1
interfere 1
with 1
the 1
investigation 1
of 1
a 1
case. 1
i 1
stayed 1
for 1
the 1
most 1
part 1
at 1
coombe 1
tracey, 1
and 1
only 1
used 1
the 1
hut 1
upon 1
the 1
moor 1
when 1
it 1
was 1
necessary 1
to 1
be 1
near 1
the 1
scene 1
of 1
action. 1
cartwright 1
had 1
come 1
down 1
with 1
me, 1
and 1
in 1
his 1
disguise 1
as 1
a 1
country 1
boy 1
he 1
was 1
of 1
great 1
assistance 1
to 1
me. 1
i 1
was 1
dependent 1
upon 1
him 1
for 1
food 1
and 1
clean 1
linen. 1
when 1
i 1
was 1
watching 1
stapleton, 1
cartwright 1
was 1
frequently 1
watching 1
you, 1
so 1
that 1
i 1
was 1
able 1
to 1
keep 1
my 1
hand 1
upon 1
all 1
the 1
strings. 1
“i 1
have 1
already 1
told 1
you 1
that 1
your 1
reports 1
reached 1
me 1
rapidly, 1
being 1
forwarded 1
instantly 1
from 1
baker 1
street 1
to 1
coombe 1
tracey. 1
they 1
were 1
of 1
great 1
service 1
to 1
me, 1
and 1
especially 1
that 1
one 1
incidentally 1
truthful 1
piece 1
of 1
biography 1
of 1
stapleton’s. 1
i 1
was 1
able 1
to 1
establish 1
the 1
identity 1
of 1
the 1
man 1
and 1
the 1
woman 1
and 1
knew 1
at 1
last 1
exactly 1
how 1
i 1
stood. 1
the 1
case 1
had 1
been 1
considerably 1
complicated 1
through 1
the 1
incident 1
of 1
the 1
escaped 1
convict 1
and 1
the 1
relations 1
between 1
him 1
and 1
the 1
barrymores. 1
this 1
also 1
you 1
cleared 1
up 1
in 1
a 1
very 1
effective 1
way, 1
though 1
i 1
had 1
already 1
come 1
to 1
the 1
same 1
conclusions 1
from 1
my 1
own 1
observations. 1
“by 1
the 1
time 1
that 1
you 1
discovered 1
me 1
upon 1
the 1
moor 1
i 1
had 1
a 1
complete 1
knowledge 1
of 1
the 1
whole 1
business, 1
but 1
i 1
had 1
not 1
a 1
case 1
which 1
could 1
go 1
to 1
a 1
jury. 1
even 1
stapleton’s 1
attempt 1
upon 1
sir 1
henry 1
that 1
night 1
which 1
ended 1
in 1
the 1
death 1
of 1
the 1
unfortunate 1
convict 1
did 1
not 1
help 1
us 1
much 1
in 1
proving 1
murder 1
against 1
our 1
man. 1
there 1
seemed 1
to 1
be 1
no 1
alternative 1
but 1
to 1
catch 1
him 1
red-handed, 1
and 1
to 1
do 1
so 1
we 1
had 1
to 1
use 1
sir 1
henry, 1
alone 1
and 1
apparently 1
unprotected, 1
as 1
a 1
bait. 1
we 1
did 1
so, 1
and 1
at 1
the 1
cost 1
of 1
a 1
severe 1
shock 1
to 1
our 1
client 1
we 1
succeeded 1
in 1
completing 1
our 1
case 1
and 1
driving 1
stapleton 1
to 1
his 1
destruction. 1
that 1
sir 1
henry 1
should 1
have 1
been 1
exposed 1
to 1
this 1
is, 1
i 1
must 1
confess, 1
a 1
reproach 1
to 1
my 1
management 1
of 1
the 1
case, 1
but 1
we 1
had 1
no 1
means 1
of 1
foreseeing 1
the 1
terrible 1
and 1
paralyzing 1
spectacle 1
which 1
the 1
beast 1
presented, 1
nor 1
could 1
we 1
predict 1
the 1
fog 1
which 1
enabled 1
him 1
to 1
burst 1
upon 1
us 1
at 1
such 1
short 1
notice. 1
we 1
succeeded 1
in 1
our 1
object 1
at 1
a 1
cost 1
which 1
both 1
the 1
specialist 1
and 1
dr. 1
mortimer 1
assure 1
me 1
will 1
be 1
a 1
temporary 1
one. 1
a 1
long 1
journey 1
may 1
enable 1
our 1
friend 1
to 1
recover 1
not 1
only 1
from 1
his 1
shattered 1
nerves 1
but 1
also 1
from 1
his 1
wounded 1
feelings. 1
his 1
love 1
for 1
the 1
lady 1
was 1
deep 1
and 1
sincere, 1
and 1
to 1
him 1
the 1
saddest 1
part 1
of 1
all 1
this 1
black 1
business 1
was 1
that 1
he 1
should 1
have 1
been 1
deceived 1
by 1
her. 1
“it 1
only 1
remains 1
to 1
indicate 1
the 1
part 1
which 1
she 1
had 1
played 1
throughout. 1
there 1
can 1
be 1
no 1
doubt 1
that 1
stapleton 1
exercised 1
an 1
influence 1
over 1
her 1
which 1
may 1
have 1
been 1
love 1
or 1
may 1
have 1
been 1
fear, 1
or 1
very 1
possibly 1
both, 1
since 1
they 1
are 1
by 1
no 1
means 1
incompatible 1
emotions. 1
it 1
was, 1
at 1
least, 1
absolutely 1
effective. 1
at 1
his 1
command 1
she 1
consented 1
to 1
pass 1
as 1
his 1
sister, 1
though 1
he 1
found 1
the 1
limits 1
of 1
his 1
power 1
over 1
her 1
when 1
he 1
endeavoured 1
to 1
make 1
her 1
the 1
direct 1
accessory 1
to 1
murder. 1
she 1
was 1
ready 1
to 1
warn 1
sir 1
henry 1
so 1
far 1
as 1
she 1
could 1
without 1
implicating 1
her 1
husband, 1
and 1
again 1
and 1
again 1
she 1
tried 1
to 1
do 1
so. 1
stapleton 1
himself 1
seems 1
to 1
have 1
been 1
capable 1
of 1
jealousy, 1
and 1
when 1
he 1
saw 1
the 1
baronet 1
paying 1
court 1
to 1
the 1
lady, 1
even 1
though 1
it 1
was 1
part 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
plan, 1
still 1
he 1
could 1
not 1
help 1
interrupting 1
with 1
a 1
passionate 1
outburst 1
which 1
revealed 1
the 1
fiery 1
soul 1
which 1
his 1
self-contained 1
manner 1
so 1
cleverly 1
concealed. 1
by 1
encouraging 1
the 1
intimacy 1
he 1
made 1
it 1
certain 1
that 1
sir 1
henry 1
would 1
frequently 1
come 1
to 1
merripit 1
house 1
and 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
sooner 1
or 1
later 1
get 1
the 1
opportunity 1
which 1
he 1
desired. 1
on 1
the 1
day 1
of 1
the 1
crisis, 1
however, 1
his 1
wife 1
turned 1
suddenly 1
against 1
him. 1
she 1
had 1
learned 1
something 1
of 1
the 1
death 1
of 1
the 1
convict, 1
and 1
she 1
knew 1
that 1
the 1
hound 1
was 1
being 1
kept 1
in 1
the 1
outhouse 1
on 1
the 1
evening 1
that 1
sir 1
henry 1
was 1
coming 1
to 1
dinner. 1
she 1
taxed 1
her 1
husband 1
with 1
his 1
intended 1
crime, 1
and 1
a 1
furious 1
scene 1
followed 1
in 1
which 1
he 1
showed 1
her 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
that 1
she 1
had 1
a 1
rival 1
in 1
his 1
love. 1
her 1
fidelity 1
turned 1
in 1
an 1
instant 1
to 1
bitter 1
hatred, 1
and 1
he 1
saw 1
that 1
she 1
would 1
betray 1
him. 1
he 1
tied 1
her 1
up, 1
therefore, 1
that 1
she 1
might 1
have 1
no 1
chance 1
of 1
warning 1
sir 1
henry, 1
and 1
he 1
hoped, 1
no 1
doubt, 1
that 1
when 1
the 1
whole 1
countryside 1
put 1
down 1
the 1
baronet’s 1
death 1
to 1
the 1
curse 1
of 1
his 1
family, 1
as 1
they 1
certainly 1
would 1
do, 1
he 1
could 1
win 1
his 1
wife 1
back 1
to 1
accept 1
an 1
accomplished 1
fact 1
and 1
to 1
keep 1
silent 1
upon 1
what 1
she 1
knew. 1
in 1
this 1
i 1
fancy 1
that 1
in 1
any 1
case 1
he 1
made 1
a 1
miscalculation, 1
and 1
that, 1
if 1
we 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
there, 1
his 1
doom 1
would 1
none 1
the 1
less 1
have 1
been 1
sealed. 1
a 1
woman 1
of 1
spanish 1
blood 1
does 1
not 1
condone 1
such 1
an 1
injury 1
so 1
lightly. 1
and 1
now, 1
my 1
dear 1
watson, 1
without 1
referring 1
to 1
my 1
notes, 1
i 1
cannot 1
give 1
you 1
a 1
more 1
detailed 1
account 1
of 1
this 1
curious 1
case. 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
that 1
anything 1
essential 1
has 1
been 1
left 1
unexplained.” 1
“he 1
could 1
not 1
hope 1
to 1
frighten 1
sir 1
henry 1
to 1
death 1
as 1
he 1
had 1
done 1
the 1
old 1
uncle 1
with 1
his 1
bogie 1
hound.” 1
“the 1
beast 1
was 1
savage 1
and 1
half-starved. 1
if 1
its 1
appearance 1
did 1
not 1
frighten 1
its 1
victim 1
to 1
death, 1
at 1
least 1
it 1
would 1
paralyze 1
the 1
resistance 1
which 1
might 1
be 1
offered.” 1
“no 1
doubt. 1
there 1
only 1
remains 1
one 1
difficulty. 1
if 1
stapleton 1
came 1
into 1
the 1
succession, 1
how 1
could 1
he 1
explain 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
he, 1
the 1
heir, 1
had 1
been 1
living 1
unannounced 1
under 1
another 1
name 1
so 1
close 1
to 1
the 1
property? 1
how 1
could 1
he 1
claim 1
it 1
without 1
causing 1
suspicion 1
and 1
inquiry?” 1
“it 1
is 1
a 1
formidable 1
difficulty, 1
and 1
i 1
fear 1
that 1
you 1
ask 1
too 1
much 1
when 1
you 1
expect 1
me 1
to 1
solve 1
it. 1
the 1
past 1
and 1
the 1
present 1
are 1
within 1
the 1
field 1
of 1
my 1
inquiry, 1
but 1
what 1
a 1
man 1
may 1
do 1
in 1
the 1
future 1
is 1
a 1
hard 1
question 1
to 1
answer. 1
mrs. 1
stapleton 1
has 1
heard 1
her 1
husband 1
discuss 1
the 1
problem 1
on 1
several 1
occasions. 1
there 1
were 1
three 1
possible 1
courses. 1
he 1
might 1
claim 1
the 1
property 1
from 1
south 1
america, 1
establish 1
his 1
identity 1
before 1
the 1
british 1
authorities 1
there 1
and 1
so 1
obtain 1
the 1
fortune 1
without 1
ever 1
coming 1
to 1
england 1
at 1
all, 1
or 1
he 1
might 1
adopt 1
an 1
elaborate 1
disguise 1
during 1
the 1
short 1
time 1
that 1
he 1
need 1
be 1
in 1
london; 1
or, 1
again, 1
he 1
might 1
furnish 1
an 1
accomplice 1
with 1
the 1
proofs 1
and 1
papers, 1
putting 1
him 1
in 1
as 1
heir, 1
and 1
retaining 1
a 1
claim 1
upon 1
some 1
proportion 1
of 1
his 1
income. 1
we 1
cannot 1
doubt 1
from 1
what 1
we 1
know 1
of 1
him 1
that 1
he 1
would 1
have 1
found 1
some 1
way 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
difficulty. 1
and 1
now, 1
my 1
dear 1
watson, 1
we 1
have 1
had 1
some 1
weeks 1
of 1
severe 1
work, 1
and 1
for 1
one 1
evening, 1
i 1
think, 1
we 1
may 1
turn 1
our 1
thoughts 1
into 1
more 1
pleasant 1
channels. 1
i 1
have 1
a 1
box 1
for 1
_les 1
huguenots_. 1
have 1
you 1
heard 1
the 1
de 1
reszkes? 1
might 1
i 1
trouble 1
you 1
then 1
to 1
be 1
ready 1
in 1
half 1
an 1
hour, 1
and 1
we 1
can 1
stop 1
at 1
marcini’s 1
for 1
a 1
little 1
dinner 1
on 1
the 1
way?” 1
